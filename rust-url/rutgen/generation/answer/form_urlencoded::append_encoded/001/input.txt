1. Input string `s` can be an empty string, a single character, or a long string (1 to 1000 characters).
2. `string` is a mutable `String` that can start as empty or pre-filled (initial length 0 to 1000 characters).
3. `encoding` is either None or a valid function reference implementing the encoding logic, which may modify the input string.
4. Edge cases include passing in special characters in `s` (e.g., whitespace, punctuation, and non-UTF-8 characters) and verifying that proper handling occurs without runtime errors.
