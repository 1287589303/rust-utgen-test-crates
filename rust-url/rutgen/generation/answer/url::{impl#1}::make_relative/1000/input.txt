Valid inputs must have:
1. Both URLs having a valid scheme, host, and port that are identical.
2. Base URL must not have a hierarchical structure (allowing it to be a relative base).
3. URL paths must be different so that path segments can exist.
4. The filename of the base URL must be empty or represent a directory.
5. The target URL must have both a query and a fragment.
6. The constructed relative URL must encompass both path and potentially a filename, ensuring it reflects a valid transformation with appropriate separators (i.e., "/" and "?"). 

Therefore, the test input conditions or ranges:
1. Base URL without a path or directory structure (e.g., "https://example.com/"), and target URL with complex file paths including query and fragment.
2. Base URL example: "https://example.com/" and target URL example: "https://example.com/path/file.ext?query=value#fragment"; where both scheme, host and port continue to be consistent across all variations.
3. Base URL: "https://example.com/", target URL: "https://example.com/other_path/file.html?query1=value1&query2=value2#section", where base and target share the top-level domain and port but vary in single path segments demonstrating possible relative transformations resulting in non-empty outputs.
