Input bytes must include at least one byte that is not `%`, `*`, `-`, `.`, `0-9`, `A-Z`, `_`, `a-z`, and should start with a byte that is not `b' '` (e.g., any byte from `b'\x00'` to `b'\x2F'` or `b'\x3A'` to `b'\xFF'`), and should exclude any characters that would lead to an unchanged condition according to `byte_serialized_unchanged`.
