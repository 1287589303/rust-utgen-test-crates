Valid URL strings with and without query parameters (e.g., "https://example.com/path?query=value", "http://example.com", "ftp://user:pass@host:port/path?key=value#fragment") to validate presence and correctness of query strings; also include edge cases such as empty query strings (e.g., "https://example.com/?") and special characters in query values (e.g., "https://example.com/?query=%20%26%3D"); test with URLs that have fragments to ensure they are correctly ignored (e.g., "https://example.com/?key=value#fragment").
