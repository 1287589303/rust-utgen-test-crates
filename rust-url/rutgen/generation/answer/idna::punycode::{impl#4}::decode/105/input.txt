Input must be an array of PunycodeCodeUnit type with at least one valid delimiter, where the first part (before delimiter) contains non-ASCII characters due to C::EXTERNAL_CALLER being false, and the second part after the delimiter needs to be such that the conditions at lines 213 and 214 produce valid values; additionally ensure k >= INITIAL_BIAS + T_MAX (k == 1 + T_MAX), digit == t for at least one character, with the lack of further characters to process after the first iteration.
