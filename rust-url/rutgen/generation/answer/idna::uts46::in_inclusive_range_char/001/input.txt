input character 'c' must be within the range of ASCII characters (0 to 127) while 'start' and 'end' must be valid characters defining a range where 'start' is less than or equal to 'end', with edge cases including 'start' equal to 'end' and 'c' being exactly 'start' or 'end'; test with maximum character values for 'start' and 'end' as well as minimum for comprehensive coverage.
