Valid URL strings with varying schemes and query parameters, including edge cases with no queries, malformed URLs, and boundaries at different segment positions; e.g., "http://example.com/path?query", "https://user:pass@example.com/path#fragment", "ftp://example.com/path", "http://example.com/path?", "http://example.com/", "http://example.com/path#"; invalid entries like "://example.com", "http://:80/path", and extremely long URLs for performance testing.
