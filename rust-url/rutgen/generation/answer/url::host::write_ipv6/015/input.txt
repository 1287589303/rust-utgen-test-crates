addr should be an Ipv6Addr with segments containing a mix of zero and non-zero values, with at least one segment being non-zero such that longest_zero_sequence returns compress_start and compress_end where compress_start is not equal to i for all iterations before i reaches 8, and segments must not contain more than one zero segment, also ensure f can successfully write strings.
