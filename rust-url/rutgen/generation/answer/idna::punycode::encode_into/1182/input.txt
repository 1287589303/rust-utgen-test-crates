test input conditions or ranges: input with no ASCII characters (only non-ASCII), input length that does not exceed u32::MAX - 1, basic length equal to 1 (to ensure basic_length > 0), C::EXTERNAL_CALLER as false, processed less than input length, and valid delta that leads to a write error on output.write_char(value_to_digit(value)) depending on value exceeding char::MAX or valid calculations leading to panic in value_to_digit function.
