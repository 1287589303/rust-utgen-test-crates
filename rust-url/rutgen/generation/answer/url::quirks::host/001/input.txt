valid Url structures with various schemes (e.g., "http", "https", "ftp"), including absolute paths, hierarchical and non-hierarchical paths, valid usernames/passwords, hosts with and without ports, and a mix of query and fragment components; edge cases include minimal valid Urls (e.g., "http://example.com", "ftp://user:pass@example.com:8080/path?query#fragment") and invalid Urls that test error handling (e.g., missing scheme, empty host)
