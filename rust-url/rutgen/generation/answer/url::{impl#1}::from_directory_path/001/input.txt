path must be an absolute directory path on Unix (e.g., "/var/www") or a valid Windows disk prefix path (e.g., "C:\\path\\to\\directory") or UNC path (e.g., "\\\\server\\share") that must be complete and valid, avoiding empty or non-existing paths, ensuring to test special cases like trailing slashes, broken paths, and invalid characters.
