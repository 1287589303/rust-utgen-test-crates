Input conditions should include both valid and invalid URL formats, covering various schemes (e.g., http, https, file, ftp, and invalid ones) while ensuring to check edge cases like empty strings and malformed URLs. Possible test inputs range should be: valid URLs like "http://example.com", "file:///tmp/foo", "https://secure-site.com", invalid URLs like "invalid-url", "", and malformed URLs like "http:///tmp/foo". Additionally, consider URLs with non-standard schemes like "moz://example.com" and special cases for encoding or characters limit in the scheme.
