Valid test inputs for set_ip_host include: "mailto:rms@example.com" as the input URL to ensure cannot_be_a_base() returns true, and various valid IPv4 addresses such as "127.0.0.1", "192.168.1.1", as well as valid IPv6 addresses like "2001:db8::ff00:42:8329" to test both paths and ensure they are handled correctly when the URL is in a valid state.
