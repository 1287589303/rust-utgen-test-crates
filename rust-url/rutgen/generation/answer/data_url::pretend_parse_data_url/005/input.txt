Input strings must start with "data:" (case-insensitive) followed by any characters, optionally prefixed by whitespace or control characters, and the "data:" prefix must not be trimmed for the function to return Some(result), while passing strings like "data: ", "Data: 123", "DaTa:hello world!" and ensure edge cases with strings like "data:\n\ttext", "   data:abc " are included.
