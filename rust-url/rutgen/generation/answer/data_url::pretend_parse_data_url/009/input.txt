Test input conditions or ranges: Input strings must start with "data:" (case insensitive), can include leading spaces, and should not contain any ASCII newline or tab characters before the "data:" prefix; failing inputs should test for various strings not starting with "data:", like "data1:", " Data:", or "  data: "; edge cases should include empty strings, strings with only whitespace, and strings with characters following "data:" that result in no valid return value.
