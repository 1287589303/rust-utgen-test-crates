self.chars() must contain a sequence of characters that matches the expected characters read from input, which can be an empty string, a single character, or a larger sequence of characters up to the length of the input, ensuring input.next() provides those characters sequentially; boundary cases include an empty input or a single character input that matches the first character of self.chars().
