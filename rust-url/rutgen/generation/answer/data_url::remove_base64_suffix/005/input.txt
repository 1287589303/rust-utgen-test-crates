Test input conditions or ranges: 
1. Strings ending with valid base64 suffixes that include '4' and '6' preceded by 'e', 's', 'a', 'b', with a semicolon but with additional characters, such as "DataURL; validBase64String" 
2. Strings containing only whitespace followed by a valid base64 suffix "    ;base64Data" 
3. Strings that don't contain valid suffixes at all "data without suffix" 
4. Strings with valid suffixes that do not conform exactly, i.e., missing '4' or '6' or have invalid characters or sequences like ";;;"
5. Strings with base64 suffixes but ending prematurely before '4' or '6', such as "string456e"; 
6. Strings where line ending characters are included, such as "dataUrl\n;\t4998" 
7. Empty strings to check base conditions and behavior at bounds.
