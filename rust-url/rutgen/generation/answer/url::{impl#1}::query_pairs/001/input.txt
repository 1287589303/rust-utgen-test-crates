valid URL strings containing query parameters with various combinations of characters, including:
1. A typical URL with multiple query parameters (e.g., "https://example.com/products?page=2&sort=desc")
2. A URL with no query parameters (e.g., "https://example.com/products")
3. A URL with a single query parameter (e.g., "https://example.com/?key=value")
4. A URL with special characters in parameters (e.g., "https://example.com/search?query=hello%20world&sort=asc")
5. URLs with empty parameters (e.g., "https://example.com/?key=&another=")
6. A URL with only a fragment and no query (e.g., "https://example.com/#section")
7. URLs with malformed query strings (e.g., "https://example.com/?key=value&=value") to test error handling
8. Edge case URLs such as "https://example.com/?" to check behavior with trailing question marks.
