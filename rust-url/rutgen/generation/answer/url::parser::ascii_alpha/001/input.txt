Test input conditions or ranges: input character 'ch' must be a single character from the set of ASCII alphabetic characters (from 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z') as well as edge cases like non-ASCII characters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace to ensure boolean return values of true (for alphabetic) and false (for non-alphabetic).
