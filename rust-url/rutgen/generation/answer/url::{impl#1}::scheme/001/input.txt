Valid test inputs for the scheme function should include valid URLs containing various schemes, edge cases like empty strings, malformed URLs, and URLs with and without a scheme. Here are the defined test input conditions:

A valid URL string including "http://example.com", "https://example.com", "ftp://ftp.example.com", "file:///tmp/foo", a completely malformed URL string (e.g., "://invalid"), an empty string "", and a string without a scheme "example.com".
