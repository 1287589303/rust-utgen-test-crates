encoded_body_plus_fragment includes valid percent-encoded sequences like "%20", a "#" fragment, and ASCII characters, with scenarios like empty strings, strings without special characters, and various ASCII control characters; also consider boundary cases for encoded sequences (e.g., "%00" for null byte, "%3A" for ":"), while ensuring at least one special byte like '%' and terminating before or on the first fragment marker '#'.
