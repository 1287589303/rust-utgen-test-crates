Test input conditions or ranges: encoded_body_plus_fragment should start with valid percent-encoded values followed by valid hexadecimal characters (e.g., "Hello%20World%21#fragment") with no special characters following the '%' up to the first '#', and no other special characters between '#' and the end of the string; ensuring that byte matches once on all byte types being tested and include edge cases like "Hello%ZZ#fragment" to expect error handling on invalid percent encoding.
