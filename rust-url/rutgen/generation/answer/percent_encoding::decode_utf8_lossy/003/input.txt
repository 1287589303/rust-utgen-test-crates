input condition: Cow::Owned containing byte arrays that decode to valid UTF-8 strings where the original bytes are not strictly UTF-8 but valid for lossless decoding, including special characters and boundary values like empty arrays, arrays with one element (0-255), and larger arrays with potential invalid sequences that still produce valid UTF-8 representations.
