  "doc": "/// Performs the [ToUnicode](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToUnicode) operation\n/// from UTS #46 according to the options given. When there\n/// are errors, there is still output, which may be rendered user, even through\n/// the output must not be used in networking protocols. Errors are denoted\n/// by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs in the output. (That is, if the second item of the\n/// return tuple is `Err`, the first item of the return tuple is guaranteed to contain\n/// at least one U+FFFD.)\n///\n/// Most applications probably shouldn't use this method and should be using\n/// [`Uts46::to_user_interface`] instead.\n///\n/// # Arguments\n///\n/// * `domain_name` - The input domain name as UTF-8 bytes. (The UTF-8ness is checked by\n///   this method and input that is not well-formed UTF-8 is treated as an error. If you\n///   already have a `&str`, call `.as_bytes()` on it.)\n/// * `ascii_deny_list` - What ASCII deny list, if any, to apply. The UTS 46\n///   _UseSTD3ASCIIRules_ flag or the WHATWG URL Standard forbidden domain code point\n///   processing is handled via this argument. Most callers are probably the best off\n///   by using [`AsciiDenyList::URL`] here.\n/// * `hyphens` - The UTS 46 _CheckHyphens_ flag. Most callers are probably the best\n///   off by using [`Hyphens::Allow`] here.\n",
