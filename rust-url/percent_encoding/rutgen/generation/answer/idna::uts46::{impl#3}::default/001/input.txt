Valid inputs for the domain_name parameter as byte slices of valid UTF-8 encoded characters, lengths of domain_name between 1 and 2000 for to_ascii and to_unicode functions, with ascii_deny_list allowing or disallowing specific ASCII characters, hyphens being either allowed or not, error_policy being either strict or lenient, and potential variations in output_as_unicode function behavior based on domain_name content.
