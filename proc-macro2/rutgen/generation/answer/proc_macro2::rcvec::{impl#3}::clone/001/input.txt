Test input conditions or ranges: RcVec with inner being an empty Vec<T>, a Vec<T> with one element, a Vec<T> with multiple elements (e.g., 2 to 100), and ensure it handles cloning across different types of T (e.g., primitive types, complex types, and types implementing Clone trait) including edge cases such as RcVec with inner set to None or already cloned instances.
