Test input conditions or ranges: Test with a single character input where 'c' falls within the range of valid unicode identifiers (e.g., letters, digits, underscore) and also test with characters outside this range (e.g., punctuation, whitespace, special characters) including boundary cases such as the start of the unicode range or non-alphanumeric symbols.
