input.rest should be a string with characters that include at least one underscore '_', does not start with "0x", "0o", or "0b", contains no digits '0'-'9', no hex characters 'a'-'f' or 'A'-'F', and has a valid first character following one or more underscores to form a valid sequence, ensuring input ends after the underscores are processed.
