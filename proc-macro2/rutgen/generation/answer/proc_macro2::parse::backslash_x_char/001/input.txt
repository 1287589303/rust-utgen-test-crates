Input conditions for `chars`: iterator over pairs of (usize, char) where first value is any index and second value follows the sequence (leading char in ['0'-'7'], second char in ['0'-'9'] or ['a'-'f'] or ['A'-'F']), ensuring valid transitions and satisfying all preconditions for the function to return Ok(())
