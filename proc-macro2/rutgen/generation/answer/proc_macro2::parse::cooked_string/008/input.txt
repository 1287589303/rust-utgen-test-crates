Input conditions: Non-empty string containing at least one backslash followed by a valid escape sequence ('u', 'x', 'n', 'r', 't', '\\', '\'', '"', '0') and potentially trailing whitespace, ensuring that the string does not end with a valid character sequence that matches the expected conditions for success.
