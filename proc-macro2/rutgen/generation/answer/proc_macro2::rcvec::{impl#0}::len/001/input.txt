Test input conditions or ranges: an instance of RcVec with various states: empty RcVec, RcVec with one element, RcVec with multiple elements (e.g., 10, 100), and a RcVec created with various types of elements (e.g., integers, strings), including checking boundary cases like maximum possible size of Vec<T>.
