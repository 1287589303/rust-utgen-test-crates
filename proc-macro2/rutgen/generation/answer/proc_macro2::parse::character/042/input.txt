valid inputs: any string starting with a single quote followed by a backslash, which itself is followed by a 'u', 'x', or one of the escape characters ('n', 'r', 't', '\\', '0', '\'', '"'), ending with a single quote; invalid input should also be included: strings without correct escaping or improperly closed strings; character count >= 3 and <= 100; ensure leading and trailing whitespace does not interfere with parsing
