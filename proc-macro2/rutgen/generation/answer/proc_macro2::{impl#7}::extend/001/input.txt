The input conditions or ranges for the `extend` function should include: a non-empty iterator of `TokenStream` items, an empty iterator of `TokenStream`, an iterator with a single `TokenStream`, iterators containing a mix of `Compiler` and `Fallback` variants of `TokenStream`, and boundary cases like iterators with a very large number of `TokenStream` items and iterators with zero items.
