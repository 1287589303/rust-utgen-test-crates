Test input conditions or ranges: Input iterator containing pairs where the first element is an integer and the second character is '{', followed by an underscore '_' for the sixth character, ensuring no hexadecimal digits ('0'-'9', 'a'-'f', 'A'-'F') are present before the underscore and using a total length that produces no valid hexadecimal character before the closing '}'.
