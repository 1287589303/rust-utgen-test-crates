Input should be a mutable iterator that returns both valid hexadecimal digits ('0'-'9', 'a'-'f', 'A'-'F'), a valid starting '{' character, and should eventually include a valid closing '}' character with a maximum of 6 characters in between to ensure a successful return of a char, and a test case with no characters (empty iterator) to confirm it returns Err(Reject).
