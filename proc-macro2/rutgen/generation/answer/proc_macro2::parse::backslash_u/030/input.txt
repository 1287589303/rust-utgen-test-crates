Test input conditions: 'chars' iterator should start with a character sequence beginning with '{', followed by at least one character in the range 'a'..='f', and no characters in the range '0'..='9', with a maximum of five hexadecimal digits before encountering a '}' or terminating with an invalid character, ensuring 'len' is less than 6 throughout to trigger Err(Reject).
