Input string should be a single digit between '0' and '9' followed by valid floating point characters like '.' or 'e', and cases where the first character is not a digit ('a', '-', '#', etc.) should also be tested for error: e.g., "a", "10.5e10", "9e+3", "3.", "12_34", or "2.3e-4" for valid cases, plus "ab", "12.34e", "2..3" for errors.
