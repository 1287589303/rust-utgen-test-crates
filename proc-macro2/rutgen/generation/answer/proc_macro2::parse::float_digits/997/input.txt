Cursor with rest being a string that starts with a digit (e.g., "1", "5", "9") and contains either a valid float with no dots (e.g., "123E+1", "456", "789") or a valid float with one dot (e.g., "1.23", "4.5e-3") and optionally valid exponential parts (like "e-1", "E+2") while ensuring valid characters after dot/exponent.
