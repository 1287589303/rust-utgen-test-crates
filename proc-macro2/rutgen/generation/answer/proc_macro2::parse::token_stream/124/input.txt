Cursor input with: an empty string, a string consisting solely of whitespace, a string with balanced delimiters like "()", "[]", "{}", and a string containing a documentation comment format like "// comment" or "/// comment"; specifically, test cases where no tokens push to the stack and lead directly to building the TokenStream or situations leading to different stages of input processing, ensuring edge cases like non-empty strings without valid tokens and mixed valid/invalid cases are included.
