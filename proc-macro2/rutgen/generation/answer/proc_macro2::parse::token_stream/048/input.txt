input must be a non-empty string containing a combination of whitespace, valid opening/closing delimiters (specifically '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', or ']'), and an ERROR token located anywhere after the whitespace but before any valid delimiter, as well as ensuring not to contain any closing delimiter corresponding to an opening delimiter present in the stack by the end of input; length range should cover at least 1 to arbitrary large string length to reflect edge cases.
