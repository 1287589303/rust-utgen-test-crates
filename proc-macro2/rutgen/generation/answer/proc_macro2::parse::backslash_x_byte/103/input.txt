Test input conditions or ranges: I must produce an iterator that first yields (idx, ch) where ch is in the range of b'A' to b'F' for the first call and then yields two consecutive (idx, ch) where ch is any digit in the range of b'0' to b'9' for the second call, ensuring that the iterator is correctly advancing and supplying valid values according to the specified ranges.
