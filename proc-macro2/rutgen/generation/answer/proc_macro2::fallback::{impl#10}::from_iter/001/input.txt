1. Input must be an iterable collection of TokenTree elements, including at least one element; edge cases include an empty iterable and single-element iterables.
2. Valid TokenTree elements must include at least one instance from the enumerated types: Group, Ident, Punct, or Literal.
3. Test with multiple combinations of TokenTree types and ensure the total count of tokens matches the input count.
4. Test with boundary inputs such as very large collections up to the capacity limit of TokenStream to ensure handling of high-volume data.
5. Input must be non-repeating or include duplicates to check behavior with identical TokenTree instances.
