Cursor input with rest as a valid number string starting with "0x" or "0o" or "0b" followed by at least one valid digit for the respective base, and followed by a character that satisfies is_ident_start, for example "0x1aA_" or "0o57a", ensuring length and valid characters for numeric and identifier parsing, not empty.
