self.inner must be an instance of Rc<Vec<T>> where T is any type, and valid scenarios for testing include: RcVec<T> with inner being an empty vector (length 0), RcVec<T> with inner being a vector containing one element (length 1), and RcVec<T> with inner being a vector containing multiple elements (length > 1).
