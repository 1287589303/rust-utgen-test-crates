R must be a type implementing Read<'de> that simulates a stream of input causing a deserialization error (e.g., invalid JSON format or unexpected character), T must be a type implementing de::Deserialize<'de> that could reasonably fail (e.g., a struct with mandatory fields), while also testing edge conditions like empty input, malformed input, or inputs with extra characters after valid data.
