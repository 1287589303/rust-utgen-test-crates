char input values: range from '\u{0000}' (null character) to '\u{10FFFF}' (maximum valid Unicode code point) including boundary cases like '\u{007F}' (DEL), '\u{D800}' and '\u{DFFF}' (surrogate pairs), and special characters like '\u{0041}' (uppercase 'A') and '\u{FFFD}' (replacement character) which should represent a mix of valid and invalid scenarios.
