Self must implement the Read trait, scratch must be a mutable reference to a Vec<u8>, and expected return is a Result containing Reference to a string or an error if parsing fails. Valid inputs for scratch length are from 0 to several kilobytes, and when testing invalid inputs, it should be ensured to include cases with extreme values or incorrect formats.
