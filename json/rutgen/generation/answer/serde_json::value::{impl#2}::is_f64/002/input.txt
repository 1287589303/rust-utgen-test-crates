self is of type Value::Number with various numeric representations, including integers and floating-point numbers; test inputs should include a mix of valid f64 float values (e.g., 0.0, 1.0, -1.0, std::f64::MAX, std::f64::MIN), valid integers (e.g., 1, 2^31-1, -2^31), edge float values such as NaN and Infinity, as well as the corresponding numeric types checked by `is_i64` and `is_u64` methods.
