Input values should be valid data structures that implement the Serialize trait, including edge cases like empty data structures, serialization of nested structures, and large structures to test performance limits; ensure to include cases with valid non-string keys in maps and verify invalid scenarios that might cause serialization to fail (e.g., non-serializable types).
