Value types should cover the following conditions: Null, Bool (true/false), Number (integer and floating-point), String (non-empty and empty), Array (empty and non-empty), Object (with valid string keys and nested structures), Serialization error with non-string map keys, edge cases with large/small numeric values, and handling of empty structures.
