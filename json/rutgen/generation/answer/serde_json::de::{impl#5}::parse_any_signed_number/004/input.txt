self.peek() returns Result::Ok(Some(b'-')) or Result::Ok(Some(b'0'..=b'9')), where b'0'..=b'9' includes integers within the range of 0 to 9, and expect multiple calls returning Ok() results for different digits or minus sign followed by the numbers, also simulate the Result::Err for edge cases of peek() and underflow with large inputs.
