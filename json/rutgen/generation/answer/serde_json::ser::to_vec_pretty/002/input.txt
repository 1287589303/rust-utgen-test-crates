value must be a serializable data structure (e.g., structs, arrays, maps with string keys only, etc.), and should not contain non-string map keys or invalid serialization types (like circular references or unsupported data types), so test with simple data structures, edge cases like empty structs/maps/arrays, and complex nested structures with valid serialization paths, ensuring both boundary and typical conditions are tested.
