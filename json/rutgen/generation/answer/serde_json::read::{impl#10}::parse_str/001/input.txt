'scratch' must be a mutable reference to a Vec<u8> with at least one byte for valid UTF-8 input; 'self.delegate' must be properly initialized with a valid SliceRead type containing a non-empty slice of UTF-8 bytes; boundary cases include an empty slice and maximum size slices (e.g., 2^32-1 bytes) to test performance limits.
