Test input conditions: Provide four bytes representing hex digits, where the first three bytes (a, b, c) are valid hex characters (0-9, A-F) and the fourth byte (d) is either an invalid hex character or a valid hex character that results in None when passed to decode_four_hex_digits. Ensure that the resulting byte values fall within the range of 0 to 255 for valid hex characters and check edge cases like 'xyz' to confirm error handling.
