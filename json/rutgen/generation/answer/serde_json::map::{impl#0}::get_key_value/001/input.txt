Valid key inputs: String, &str, a mix of valid and invalid keys (e.g., empty string, non-ASCII characters, very long strings), and non-existing keys; applicable preconditions: map must be initialized with at least one entry before `get_key_value` is called; expected return types must be Option<(&String, &Value)> where Option is None for non-existing keys and Some for existing keys.
