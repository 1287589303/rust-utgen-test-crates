Test input conditions or ranges include: valid finite floating-point numbers in the range of `-1.7976931348623157e+308` to `1.7976931348623157e+308`, special cases such as `f64::MIN`, `f64::MAX`, `f64::EPSILON`, `0.0`, `-0.0`, `1.0`, `-1.0`, and edge cases like `f64::INFINITY`, `f64::NEG_INFINITY`, and `f64::NAN` (though the latter should not be used directly in the test since the function does not check for those cases).
