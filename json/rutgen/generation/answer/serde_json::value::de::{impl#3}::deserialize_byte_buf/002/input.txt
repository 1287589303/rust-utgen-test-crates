self should be an instance of Value::Array with varying lengths from 0 to N elements, where N is a reasonable upper limit (e.g., 1000), and each element should be of type Value, testing both valid and invalid cases such as including Value::String, Value::Number, and unexpected types (e.g., Value::Null and Value::Bool).
