_value must implement the Serialize trait and can accept any serializable data type including primitive types, collections, and user-defined types; input should include values such as integers (min: i8::MIN, max: i8::MAX), floats (min: f32::MIN, max: f32::MAX), booleans (true, false), strings (empty, short, long), and complex objects (nested structures)._
