value is a valid JSON serializable type including null, boolean, number, string, array, or object; the input vector containing these values must be non-empty and can vary in size from 1 to a maximum expected practical size (e.g., 1 to 1000 items) for performance testing with edge cases of minimal (1) and maximal (1000) input; also include test for empty vectors which should return a serialization error.
