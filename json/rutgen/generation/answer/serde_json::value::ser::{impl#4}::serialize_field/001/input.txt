Value types should include: `Null`, `Bool` (true/false), `Number` (integers and floats), `String` (empty and non-empty strings), `Array` (including nested arrays) with a minimum of one and a maximum of N elements, and `Object` (with at least one key-value pair in maps that can vary in key names and value types).
