- Test with an empty map to verify that `retain` does not affect the map.
- Test with a map containing several key-value pairs of varying `Value` types (Bool, Number, String, Array, Object) to check if `retain` correctly retains elements based on predicate.
- Test with a map where all key-value pairs are removed by the predicate to ensure the map is empty afterward.
- Test with a predicate that only retains pairs with specific keys, ensuring only those pairs remain.
- Test with 0 and 10,000 elements in the map to evaluate performance and correctness at boundaries.
- Test with keys containing special characters and keys with varying lengths (including empty string) to validate key handling.
