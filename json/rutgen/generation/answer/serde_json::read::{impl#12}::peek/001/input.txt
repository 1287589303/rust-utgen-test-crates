Test input conditions or ranges: R implements the Read trait; R's buffer can contain values from 0 to 255 (inclusive); R's buffer should be non-empty; R can return None if the buffer is empty; R can return Some(value) where value is from 0 to 255; R's state must be consistent across multiple calls to peek.
