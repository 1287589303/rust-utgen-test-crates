Test input conditions or ranges: 
1. A new Map instance (empty map); 
2. A Map instance with a single key-value pair; 
3. A Map instance with multiple key-value pairs; 
4. A Map instance with a mixture of types in values (including Null, Bool, Number, String, Array, Object); 
5. A Map with maximum capacity specified (if any constraints apply); 
6. Testing on Map with and without the "preserve_order" feature enabled (both configurations); 
7. A Map with duplicate keys handled (which could test behavior in response to overwrites).
