The test input conditions or ranges should include a JSON object that consists of exactly one key-value pair, where the key is a valid string representing the variant of the enum and the value is a valid JSON value (such as a boolean, number, string, null, array, or another object). For example, input like `{"variant": true}` or `{"status": 42}` should be used to verify that the function processes the input correctly and returns a valid result, while input like `{}` or `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}` (having no pairs or multiple pairs respectively) should be used to validate that proper errors return as expected.
