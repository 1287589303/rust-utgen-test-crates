self.de.read.parse_str must handle a string that is both valid and invalid in format, including empty strings, numeric strings (e.g., "0", "123", "3.14"), boolean strings ("true", "false"), and non-string characters (e.g., "{", "/", "@"); it also needs to include long strings up to the maximum length to check robustness against overflow errors.
