Valid JSON strings including: "true", "false", "null", valid integers, valid floats, valid strings enclosed in double quotes, empty arrays `[]`, and empty objects `{}`; as well as inputs that begin with invalid characters which should trigger error handling scenarios like leading whitespace, unexpected commas, or missing quotes; values within valid ranges of JSON representation, especially around object keys, list elements, and null terminators.
