Test input conditions or ranges should include:
- input stream containing valid JSON values such as "null", "true", "false", numeric values (including integers and decimals), and JSON objects/arrays with correct nesting, ensuring invalid cases like trailing commas are avoided.  
- varying lengths for input JSON strings to test buffer handling, including minimum lengths (single characters) and maximum allowable lengths without exceeding stack limits.  
- include edge cases with whitespace variations between values and structures to validate whitespace handling in parse_whitespace().  
- test for scenarios with nested structures like arrays and objects to validate proper nesting handling.  
- explicitly test inputs that trigger ErrorCode variants like ExpectedSomeValue, EofWhileParsingValue ensuring to cover states leading to Err to validate error handling.  
- ensure tests include sequences that might exhaust the scratch buffer and validate behavior under such conditions.  
- check for inputs that relate to encoding issues, like invalid escape sequences, ensuring robust parsing behavior.
