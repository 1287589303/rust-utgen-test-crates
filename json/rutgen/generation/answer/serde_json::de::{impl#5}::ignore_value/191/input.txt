input contains valid JSON values such as null (b'n'), true (b't'), false (b'f'), a negative integer (b'-'), and a string (b'"') while ensuring self.ignore_integer() can handle integers in the range of -2^63 to 2^63-1, whitespace interrupts correctly parsed values, and cases where expected characters such as ':' and ',' are either present or absent to trigger error codes as specified.
