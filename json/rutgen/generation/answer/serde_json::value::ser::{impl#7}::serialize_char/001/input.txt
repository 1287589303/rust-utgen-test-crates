Test input conditions or ranges: any valid Unicode character, specifically including edge cases like the null character '\0', boundary characters such as the first character ('\u{0000}') to the last character ('\u{D7FF}', then '\u{E000}' to '\u{10FFFF}'), and non-graphic characters like spacing characters, control characters, and surrogate pairs.
