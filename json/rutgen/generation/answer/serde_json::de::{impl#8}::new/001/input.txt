Deserializer<R> should be a valid mutable reference with a non-null value, and R should implement the Read trait; depth of mutable reference (remaining_depth) between 0 and some upper limit (e.g., 255 for a byte), and the context of enabling the optional features ("float_roundtrip", "unbounded_depth") must be accounted for by testing scenarios both enabled and disabled.
