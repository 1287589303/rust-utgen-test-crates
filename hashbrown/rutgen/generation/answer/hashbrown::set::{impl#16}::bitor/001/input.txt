- Test with two non-empty `HashSet`s containing distinct and overlapping elements of varying types (e.g., integers, strings).
- Test with one empty `HashSet` and one non-empty `HashSet`.
- Test with two empty `HashSet`s.
- Test with two `HashSet`s that are identical.
- Test with large datasets (e.g., `HashSet`s containing 10,000+ elements).
- Test with edge cases involving the minimum and maximum count of elements (e.g., 0 and 1 element).
- Test with a `HashSet` containing elements of a custom type that implements `Eq` and `Hash`.
- Test with `HashSet`s containing negative and positive integers.
