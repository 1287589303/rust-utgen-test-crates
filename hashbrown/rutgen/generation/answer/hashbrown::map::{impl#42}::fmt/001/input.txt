self.value should be of type V (value type of HashMap), self.entry.key() should return a reference to type K (key type of HashMap), and self.entry.get() should return a reference to type V; valid instances of K and V, self.entry must be an OccupiedEntry and properly initialized, and the fmt::Formatter instance must be valid and mutable.
