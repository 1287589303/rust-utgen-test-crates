T::IS_ZERO_SIZED is true (e.g., T can be a zero-sized type like an empty struct), self.ptr must not be dangling, base must point to the end of a valid memory region corresponding to the start of a valid element, base must be created from the same RawTable as self, and base must not be null (i.e., provide a valid NonNull pointer).
