self.iter.size_hint() returns (lower, upper) where lower and upper are usize values, self.other.len() is usize, and valid inputs for self.other include empty or non-empty HashSet instances. Test input conditions/ranges: lower â‰¥ self.other.len() for non-empty self.other, and upper can be equal to or greater than the sum of sizes of self.iter and self.other, including 0 for both.
