Valid test inputs include a HashSet with zero elements, a HashSet with one element, a HashSet with multiple elements (e.g., 2, 5, 10), and a HashSet with duplicate elements (e.g., inserting "a" multiple times); test should also cover cases with different data types for T (e.g., &str, integers) and test for an empty HashSet.
