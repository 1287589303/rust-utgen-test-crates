K: any valid key type, V: any valid value type, value: V can be any value, ensuring that the key exists in the map for occupied entry (e.g., keys like "a", "b" for &str), ensure previous value exists (e.g., 0 to 1000 for u32), must test with non-existing keys to result in a panic scenario, must accommodate boundary values like min/max for value type, and nullable cases if applicable.
