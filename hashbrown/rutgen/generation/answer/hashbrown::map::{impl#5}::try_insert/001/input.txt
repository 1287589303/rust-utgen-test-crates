Test input conditions should include: a new and unique key of type K to insert (e.g., integer, string, or custom type implementing Eq and Hash traits), a corresponding value of type V, ensuring that the key has not already been inserted into the HashMap before calling try_insert(). Edge cases include: inserting a key that is the maximum and minimum value of K's type, and inserting a null or empty value for type V if applicable.
