Valid inputs include non-empty and empty instances of the `IntoIter<K, A>` struct, where `A` is any implementation of the `Allocator` trait, covering scenarios where the underlying iterator may have varying element counts such as 0 (empty), 1 (single element), and large sizes (e.g., 1000+ elements). Boundary cases should test the edge sizes of the iterator including the maximum capacity determined by the allocator implementation.
