test input conditions or ranges: 
- The `RawTable` instance should be initialized and contain at least one element to erase, ensuring that the `Bucket<T>` is valid and correctly references an existing item, meaning `self.len() > 0` and `self.is_empty()` should be false; 
- The `Bucket` passed must be valid, meaning it should point to an index within the valid range (`0` to `self.buckets() - 1`); 
- The item represented by the `Bucket` must not have been previously erased, meaning `self.is_bucket_full(index)` returns true before the erase operation.
