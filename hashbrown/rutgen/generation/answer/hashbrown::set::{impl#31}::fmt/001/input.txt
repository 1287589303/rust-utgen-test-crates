K is a type that implements fmt::Debug, and the function should handle various valid and invalid use cases for K. Consider K as different types implementing fmt::Debug, such as integers (e.g., i32, u32), strings (e.g., &str), and custom structs. Test inputs should also cover boundary cases such as an empty collection and large collections with multiple elements.
