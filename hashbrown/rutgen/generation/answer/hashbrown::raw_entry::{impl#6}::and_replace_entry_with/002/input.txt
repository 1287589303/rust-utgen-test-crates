Test input conditions: raw_entry_mut must contain an occupied entry with a valid key of type K (e.g., string or integer) and a corresponding value of type V (e.g., integer), ensuring that the key exists in the HashMap before calling and_replace_entry_with; the function F must be provided a closure that takes a reference to K and a value of V, returning an Option<V>.
