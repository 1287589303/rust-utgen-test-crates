Input condition: Guard must be an instance of ScopeGuard<T, F> where T is any type and F is a closure that takes a mutable reference of type &mut T; valid instances include (T: u32, F: |&mut u32| {}), (T: String, F: |&mut String| {}), ensuring T does not implement Drop for safe extraction; edge cases include empty types (e.g. T: ()) and closures with no operation (e.g. F: |_: &mut T| {}); maximum and minimum sizes of T should also be considered.
