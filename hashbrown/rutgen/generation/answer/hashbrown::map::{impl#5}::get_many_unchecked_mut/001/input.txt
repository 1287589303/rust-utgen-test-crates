- Test with `N` varying from 1 to maximum size of array that can fit in memory, testing with unique keys and checking returned mutable references.
- Test with overlapping keys in the input array of length `N` to ensure it results in undefined behavior handling.
- Test with keys that don't exist in the map to check for `None` in the output array.
- Test with a combination of existing and non-existing keys to validate mixed outcomes (some `Some(value)` and some `None`).
- Validate behavior when the map is empty and running `get_many_unchecked_mut` with any `N`.
