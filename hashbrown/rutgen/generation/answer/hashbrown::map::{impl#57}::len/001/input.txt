Input conditions or ranges for the `len` function should include: 
1. An instance of `IntoIter<K, V, A>` where `K` and `V` can be any valid types that implement the `Hash` trait.
2. The allocator `A` can be `Global` or any user-defined struct that implements the `Allocator` trait.
3. Variations of the `len` method should be tested with an empty iterator, a single element iterator, and large iterators (e.g., 10, 100, 1000, MAX usize - 1).
4. Boundary cases should include scenarios where the iterator transitions between empty to non-empty states (e.g., popping all elements).
