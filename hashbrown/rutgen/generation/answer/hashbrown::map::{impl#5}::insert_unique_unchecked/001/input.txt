Insert a unique key-value pair where key is of type K and value is of type V, ensuring key is not already present in the map, while also testing with boundary cases (minimum capacity, maximum capacity, and large data sizes), and using various types for K and V (e.g., integers, strings) to ensure compatibility with the HashMap's generic constraints.
