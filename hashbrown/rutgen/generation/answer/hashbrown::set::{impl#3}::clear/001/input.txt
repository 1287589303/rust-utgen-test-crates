The HashSet must be initialized with varying data types (e.g., integers, strings), and scenarios should include an empty set, a set with one element, and a set with multiple elements to test the `clear` function; test input ranges include 0 (empty set), 1 (set with one element), and N (set with N elements where N is a reasonable upper limit for performance testing).
