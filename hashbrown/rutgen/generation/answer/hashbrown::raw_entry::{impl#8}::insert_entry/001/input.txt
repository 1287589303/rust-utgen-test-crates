K must implement Hash; V can be any type; S must implement BuildHasher; test inputs should include various types for K (e.g., integers, strings, custom types) and V (e.g., integers, floats, structs) and cases where key and value pairs are inserted multiple times to trigger collision scenarios, along with edge cases of minimum and maximum values for supported types.
