Valid test input conditions should include: hash value as any valid u64 (0 to 2^64-1), a matching function is_match that accepts a reference to a key type K, and a HashMap<K, V, S, A> with at least one occupied entry for successful retrieval (key present) and a HashMap<K, V, S, A> potentially empty or with keys that do not match for testing the vacant case.
