Test input conditions or ranges include:
- `ks`: An array of keys with size `N` where `N` is a positive integer, ensuring that each key implements `Hash` and `Equivalent<K>`. Test with varying `N` values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, and limit scenarios).
- `K`: The key type must conform to both `Eq` and `Hash` traits and should include edge types like empty strings or maximum value integers.
- Each key in `ks` should include valid, invalid, and duplicate cases to validate retrieval behaviour under different scenarios (e.g., keys existing in the map, keys not existing in the map).
- Ensure the map instance (`self`) is in a valid state, with some containing key-value pairs for successful retrieval and modification tests.

Test for boundary cases like operations resulting from an empty hash map and maximum allowed keys of specified types.
