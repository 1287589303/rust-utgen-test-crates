len() should be tested with a variety of Drain instances, including:
- Empty Drain instance (zero elements)
- Drain instance with one element
- Drain instance with multiple elements (varying sizes such as 10, 100, 1000)
- Drain instance that has gone through modifications (elements being drained)
- Boundary cases such as the maximum possible elements based on the allocator's capacity
