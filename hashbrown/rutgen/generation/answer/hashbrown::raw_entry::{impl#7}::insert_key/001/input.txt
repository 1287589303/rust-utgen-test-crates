K must be a type that implements Clone, Debug, and Hash; V must implement Drop; both K and V must support allocation via the provided Allocator; valid scenarios must include the insertion of previously unoccupied and already occupied keys, handling shared ownership (e.g., Rc), edge cases with empty and full maps; test with minimum and maximum sizes for the backing storage; ensure behavior with different threading scenarios and alternative allocators.
