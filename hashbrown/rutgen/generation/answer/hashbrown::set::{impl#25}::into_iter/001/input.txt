Test input conditions/ranges: A valid HashSet instance can contain 0 to N elements of type T (where T is any type implementing Hash and Eq), with N being a non-negative integer; additionally, it should also be tested with empty set and sets containing various data types and sizes (e.g., 1 element, 2 elements, and large datasets).
