self must be an instance of IterMut with a populated inner iterator, init must be of a type that can be combined with the output of f, f must be a function that takes parameters of types B and (&'a K, &'a mut V), valid boundary tests for empty and large iterators (0, 1, 10, and maximum expected items in the iterator), and varying types of keys (K) and mutable values (V) that are compatible with the operation of f.
