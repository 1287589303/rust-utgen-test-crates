T::IS_ZERO_SIZED is true, use any valid alignment type, must test with an aligned pointer and ensure it returns a valid arbitrary zero-sized type pointer, specifically check cases with minimum and maximum aligned struct sizes (e.g., align_of::<u8>(), align_of::<u64>()), and check behavior across different zero-sized types.
