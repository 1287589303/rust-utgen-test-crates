Test input conditions or ranges: input must be a `BitMaskWord` greater than zero to ensure non-zero value and the resulting bitmask must have at least one bit set such that it doesn't trigger a None return in the `lowest_set_bit` function, e.g., input values 1 (0b0001), 2 (0b0010), 3 (0b0011), up to 0xFFFFFFFF (assuming a 32-bit mask) without leading zeros.
