N should be a positive integer, keys should be unique strings present in the HashMap, and the function should be called with a fixed-size array containing exactly N elements where each element is a valid key reference (e.g., `&str`) that implements Hash and Equivalent traits, while also covering cases with non-existing keys and a scenario with duplicate keys to test for panic behavior.
