Hash values for `hash` parameter should include valid non-negative integers, edge cases such as 0 and the maximum value for a `u64`, and a test for negative outcomes with hash values that do not correspond to any entries in the hash table; additionally, ensure the appropriate type for T is used in the test and that the hash table has elements inserted prior to invocation to validate outputs.
