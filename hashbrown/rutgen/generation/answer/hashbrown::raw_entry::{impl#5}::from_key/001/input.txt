Test input conditions or ranges: A HashMap with various key-value pairs (including different types for K and V such as &str and u32), keys for lookup (strings of varying lengths, including empty and maximum length), a valid key that exists in the map, a non-existent key, and keys of type that equate to the keys present in the map.
