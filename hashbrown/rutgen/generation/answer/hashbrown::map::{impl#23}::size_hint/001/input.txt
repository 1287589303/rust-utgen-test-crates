Self must be an instance of IntoValues<K, V, A> initialized with a properly configured inner iterator, where K, V are types of valid key and value pairs, and A is a concrete implementation of Allocator that adheres to the expected behavior of size_hint; test with different sizes: empty (0, None), single item (1, Some(1)), multiple items (2, Some(2)), and check boundaries like maximum usize (std::usize::MAX, Some(std::usize::MAX)).
