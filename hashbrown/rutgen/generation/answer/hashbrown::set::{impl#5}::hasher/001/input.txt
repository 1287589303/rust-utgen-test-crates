Test input conditions or ranges: instantiate HashSet with various types for T (e.g., i32, String, custom structs), different instances of S (various hash builders), and multiple Allocators (including Global and custom implementations), ensuring at least one case with no initial capacity and one with an explicit capacity set to zero or a positive integer.
