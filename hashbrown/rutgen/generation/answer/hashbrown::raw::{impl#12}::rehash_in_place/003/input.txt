buckets is a power of two (e.g., 8, 16, 32), size_of is a valid non-zero size of an element, hasher must return a valid hash value without panic, drop function must be the actual drop function, *guard.ctrl(i) must be Tag::DELETED for some i in 0..buckets, ensure there are more items than buckets initially for the rehashing to occur meaningfully
