Test input conditions or ranges: capacity values greater than 0, sizes of elements stored in the table (size_of) as positive integers, drop function accurately matching the element type for safe memory operations, valid hash functions that may panic, and control bytes initialized such that *guard.ctrl(i) results in Tag::DELETED for some indexes within buckets.
