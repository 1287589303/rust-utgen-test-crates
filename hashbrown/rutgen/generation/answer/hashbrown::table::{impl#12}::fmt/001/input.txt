The test input conditions or ranges should ensure that the `OccupiedEntry` contains valid initialized data, including non-null pointers and valid allocated memory for the generic type `T`, specifically when `fmt::Formatter` is provided with a reference to a `fmt::Debug` type. Thus, test input conditions should be: valid non-null pointer for `bucket.ptr`, properly instantiated `OccupiedEntry` with `HashTable<T, A>` containing at least one entry, valid `fmt::Formatter` instance, and generic `T` should implement `fmt::Debug`.
