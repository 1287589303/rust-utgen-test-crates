Valid test input conditions or ranges: the `IterMut` struct must be instantiated with a valid reference to an existing `RawIter` containing any tuple of `(K, V)` pairs such that the length of the iterator is between 0 to the maximum size representable by `usize`, including boundary cases like an empty iterator and a full iterator.
