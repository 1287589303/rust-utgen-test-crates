K and V must be types that can be stored in a HashMap, with K implementing the necessary traits for hashing and equality checks; the HashMap should be created with varying capacities (0, 1, several typical cases) using the `with_capacity_and_hasher_in` method, ensuring both empty and populated states are tested; include boundary tests for minimum and maximum capacity handling; consider cases with both empty and full HashMap to test the iterator's behavior in multiple scenarios.
