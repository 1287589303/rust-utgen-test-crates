Test input conditions or ranges: Capacity values: 0 to N (where N is a reasonable upper limit, e.g., 1000); Key types: valid K types that implement Hash and Eq; Value types: valid V types; Functionality tests with an empty HashMap, HashMap with 1 entry, a HashMap with multiple entries, and boundary cases such as maximum capacity handling and checking the keys order upon insertion.
