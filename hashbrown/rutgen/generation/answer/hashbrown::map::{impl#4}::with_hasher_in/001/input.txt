1. Hash builder of type S (e.g., DefaultHashBuilder or RandomState) that meets HashDoS resistance requirements; 
2. Allocator of type A (e.g., Global) that implements the Allocator trait; 
3. Valid capacity values (e.g., 0 to 2^30) to check initial size handling; 
4. Edge cases with minimum (0) and maximum reasonable capacities; 
5. Ensure non-empty inputs by inserting key-value pairs after creation for functionality verification; 
6. Testing with various types K and V to ensure type flexibility and error handling.
