Valid test inputs for `self` must be an instance of the `Iter` struct containing a properly initialized `RawIter` with valid `RawIterRange` and `items` attributes, and `size_hint()` should return a tuple with size values ranging from (0, Some(usize::MAX)) to cover all possible sizes, including edge cases of empty and full iterators.
