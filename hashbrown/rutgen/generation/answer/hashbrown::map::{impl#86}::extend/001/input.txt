K must be an integer type that implements Eq and Hash, V must implement Copy, the input iterator must produce tuples of references to these types, the iterator can be empty, and it can contain duplicate keys that should replace existing values. The test input conditions or ranges are: K = {i32, u32, i64, u64, usize} with values ranging from -10 to 10 for i32 and 0 to 10 for u32/i64/usize; V = {i32, u32} with values from 0 to 10; empty iterator; iterator with duplicate keys; and iterator with varying data sizes (1-10 elements).
