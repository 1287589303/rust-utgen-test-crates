T: type that implements Eq + Hash, Q: type that implements Hash + Equivalent<T> + ?Sized, f: function that takes &Q and returns T, additional inputs for f must ensure the equivalence condition is satisfied, value should be unique or existing in the structure; test cases must include min/max HashSet sizes, varying lengths for f and value inputs, both existing and non-existing inputs, and edge cases for equivalence assertions.
