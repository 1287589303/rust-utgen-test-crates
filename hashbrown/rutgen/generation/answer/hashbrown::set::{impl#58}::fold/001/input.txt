self must be an instance of Union with iterable elements, init must be of type B which is compatible with the item type of the iterator, and f must be a closure that takes two parameters: type B and an item of type Self::Item and returns type B; valid ranges might include varying types and values for B and the initial state of the iterator in the Union struct, including empty and populated iterators.
