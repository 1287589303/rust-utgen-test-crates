self.inner is an instance of RawIter<(K, V)>, which must be properly initialized and should handle cases for different sizes, including empty, single-element, and multiple elements scenarios. Thus, test input conditions or ranges: Valid sizes from 0 to N, where N is a maximum limit of elements in the iterator.
