The inferred test input conditions or ranges are: 
1. Create instances of `HashMap` with varying numbers of elements (0, 1, 10, and 1000 entries) to test memory allocation sizes.
2. Use different data types for keys and values to verify memory allocation across diverse types (e.g., integers, strings).
3. Test with an empty `HashMap` and a `HashMap` filled to capacity to assess the memory usage at both extremes.
4. Consider edge cases such as when the `HashMap` is resized (e.g., adding elements beyond initial capacity and triggering reallocation).
5. Validate memory allocation after performing operations like insertions, removals, and clearing the entire map (size should reflect changes).
