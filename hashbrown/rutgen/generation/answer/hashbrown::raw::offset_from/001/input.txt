test input conditions: valid non-null pointers for 'to' and 'from', 'to' pointer should be at or after 'from' pointer in memory, both pointers must point to the same type 'T' and must not be the same pointer, test with various data types (e.g., integers, structs), test with edge cases (e.g., pointers to the first and last elements of an array)
