K: any type that implements the Hash and Eq traits, V: any type, S: any type implementing Default, and A: any type implementing Default + Allocator; expect an empty HashMap with capacity 0. Boundary cases: empty HashMap creation with integer and string types as K and V respectively, and variations with different custom hasher types including those that require allocator implementations.
