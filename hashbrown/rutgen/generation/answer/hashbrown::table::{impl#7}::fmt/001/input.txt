The test input conditions or ranges should include: a HashTable instance with no elements, a HashTable instance with a single element, a HashTable instance with multiple elements, a HashTable instance with a capacity of zero, a HashTable instance initialized with a custom allocator, and testing with varying data types for T (e.g., integers, strings, custom structs) to ensure fmt::Debug compatibility.
