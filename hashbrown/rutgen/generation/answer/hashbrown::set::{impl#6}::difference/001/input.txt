Test input conditions: two HashSet instances `a` and `b` containing integers, where `a` has elements that include unique and overlapping values with `b`, and both sets should be initialized with varying sizes including empty sets, thus covering cases where `a` contains only unique elements, completely overlapping elements, and no elements that overlap with `b`.
