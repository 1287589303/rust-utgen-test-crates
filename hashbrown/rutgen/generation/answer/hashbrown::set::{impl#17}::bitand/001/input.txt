T: any type that implements Eq and Hash; S: any type that implements BuildHasher; A: any type that implements Allocator; rhs: &HashSet<T, S, A> must be non-empty; self: &HashSet<T, S, A> must be non-empty; expected return value: HashSet<T, S, A> with elements in the intersection of self and rhs; both HashSets must contain some common elements, including cases where there are no common elements, all elements are common, or they have the same single element.
