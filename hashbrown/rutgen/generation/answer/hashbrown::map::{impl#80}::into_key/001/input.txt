Ensure the test inputs cover the following conditions: key type `K` as a valid hashable type (e.g., `&str`, `String`, `i32`), the key must be unique and not previously inserted in the `HashMap`, the `HashMap` must be initialized correctly to avoid empty state, and the lifespan of the input key should outlive the `VacantEntry`.
