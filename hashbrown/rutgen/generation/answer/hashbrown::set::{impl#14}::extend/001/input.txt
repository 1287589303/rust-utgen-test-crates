Test input conditions: 
- A valid non-empty iterator of references to elements of type T that satisfies the traits 'Eq', 'Hash', and 'Copy', ensuring it can be extended into the HashSet. 
- An empty iterator of references to elements of type T to test the behavior when no elements are added.
- A maximum size iterator to test boundary conditions for extension capacity without triggering overflow or memory issues. 
- An iterator of varying sizes, including 1 element, to test the smallest valid input, and large sizes close to typical limits for allocators. 
- An iterator with duplicate elements to assess how the HashSet handles collisions based on the 'Eq' trait.
