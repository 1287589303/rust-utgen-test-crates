Test input conditions or ranges: K and V types for HashMap can be any valid Rust types where K supports hash and equality comparisons, the initial capacity for HashMap should be a non-negative integer (0 to N), and the number of elements in the HashMap can range from 0 (empty) to N (max capacity), with mutable references to values ensuring no aliasing; corner cases include HashMap with 1 entry, maximum entries, and full capacity scenarios.
