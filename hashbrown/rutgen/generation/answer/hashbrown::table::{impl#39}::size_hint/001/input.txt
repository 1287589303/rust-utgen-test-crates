The preconditions involve ensuring the `IntoIter` structure is properly initialized with valid types and allocator, and testing should focus on various iterator states including empty, partially filled, and completely filled scenarios.

Test input conditions or ranges: valid `IntoIter` instances initialized with diverse element counts (0, 1, max capacity) and valid allocator types (default `Global`, custom allocators), covering empty, single-element, and multiple-element scenarios to test size hints.
