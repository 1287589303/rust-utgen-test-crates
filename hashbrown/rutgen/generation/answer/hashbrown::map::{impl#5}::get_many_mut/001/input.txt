Test input conditions or ranges: N should be a positive integer value (1 to any reasonable limit based on expected usage), each key in ks must be a valid reference type matching K, there must be no duplicate keys in ks for the panic case, keys must be selected from existing entries in the HashMap for successful retrieval, and at least one key can be absent to test None results.
