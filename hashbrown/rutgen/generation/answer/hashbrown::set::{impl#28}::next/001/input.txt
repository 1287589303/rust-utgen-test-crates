The ranges for test input conditions should be defined to include valid and invalid scenarios for an Iterator with a reference to keys, such as: a non-empty hash map, an empty hash map, various sizes of the hash map (e.g., 1, 10, 100), and edge cases like maximum capacity or running out of elements.
