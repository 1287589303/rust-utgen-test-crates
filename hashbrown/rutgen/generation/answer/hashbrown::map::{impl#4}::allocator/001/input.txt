Valid test input conditions or ranges: 

- Valid instances of `HashMap<K, V, S, A>` where `K` and `V` are any valid key-value pair types, `S` is any valid hasher type, and `A` is any valid allocator type including `Global`. 
- Scenarios where `HashMap` is constructed with zero capacity, minimum capacity (e.g., 1), and large capacity values.
- Situations with different allocator implementations to ensure varied allocator types are tested.
- Edge cases with custom hash builders that may alter allocator behavior.
- Tests where `HashMap` is empty and contains elements to evaluate allocator behavior in both states.
