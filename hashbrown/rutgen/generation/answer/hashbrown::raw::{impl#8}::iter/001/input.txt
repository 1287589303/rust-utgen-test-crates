The `iter` method should be tested with the following input conditions or ranges: non-empty `RawTable` instances with properly initialized control bytes, including cases for varying capacities (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and a fully allocated `RawTable` with a range of sizes that are powers of two. Additionally, tests should include an empty `RawTable` to check for correct handling of edge cases.
