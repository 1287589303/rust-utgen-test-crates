Test input conditions or ranges: Valid `HashMap` instances with diverse key-value pairs, including empty instances, and varying capacities (0, 1, 10, maximum allowable); keys of different types (e.g., strings, integers) and values that are mutable (e.g., integers, structs) to ensure correct lifetimes and references during iteration.
