self should be an instance of Either<L, R> where L and R are mutable references, with possible values as Either::Left(l_value) for varying types L and Either::Right(r_value) for varying types R, covering boundary conditions such as when L and R are of minimum and maximum possible sizes including edge cases like empty or null references.
