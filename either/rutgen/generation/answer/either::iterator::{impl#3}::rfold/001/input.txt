self must be an instance of Either with the Right variant containing a DoubleEndedIterator, init can be any value of type Acc, and f must be a function that takes (Acc, Item) and returns Acc, where Item is the type yielded by the Right iterator; tests should include empty and non-empty iterators, Acc as both simple types (e.g., integers) and complex types (e.g., structs), and variations in f's behavior (identity function, accumulation function, etc.).
