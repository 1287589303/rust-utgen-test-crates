Test input conditions or ranges: `Either<IteratorTypeL, IteratorTypeR>` where `IteratorTypeL` and `IteratorTypeR` are valid iterator types, both yielding values compatible with the closure type defined by `F`, and both containing a mix of returning true and false for the closure applied, including edge cases of empty iterators and iterators yielding only one type of value.
