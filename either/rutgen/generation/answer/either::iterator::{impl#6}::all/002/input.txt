Input conditions for testing `all<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> bool` in `IterEither<L, R>` should include: `&mut self.inner` being a mutable reference to a valid `Either` enum instance containing a non-empty iterator of type `L`, and providing a closure function `f` that can be applied to all items of type `L::Item`, where the closure should return a boolean value (true/false) for each item.
