self = Right(value) where value is any valid type R that implements the necessary traits, including 'core::fmt::Debug', while also testing boundary cases with different types for L, including simple types (e.g., integers, strings) and complex types (e.g., structs or enums) that implement 'core::fmt::Debug'; also include a test case using Either::Left(value) to trigger panic on the condition where self is not Right.
