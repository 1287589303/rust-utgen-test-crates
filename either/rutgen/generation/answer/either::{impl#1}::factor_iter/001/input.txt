Input conditions for testing `factor_iter`: self should be an `Either` type where L is a non-empty iterable (e.g., slice, vector) and R is an iterable (e.g., vector) with at least one element; R should have item types that allow iteration and should not be empty. The left side may be either an empty iterable or not, while the right must contain at least one element.
