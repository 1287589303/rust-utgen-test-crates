The input `buf` should be a non-empty slice of bytes (`&[u8]`), while `self` must be initialized as either `Either::Left` with a valid `Write` type or `Either::Right` with a valid `Write` type, covering cases where either `L` or `R` is initialized as `None`, along with empty and maximum-sized byte arrays (e.g., length of `buf` 0 and up to 64KB).
