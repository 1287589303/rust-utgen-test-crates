test input conditions or ranges: self must be an instance of Either<L, R> where L and R are iterators yielding compatible item types (i.e., L::Item is equal to R::Item), with L producing an empty iterator, L producing a single item iterator, R producing an empty iterator, R producing a single item iterator, both L and R producing multiple items, and both L and R producing empty iterators.
