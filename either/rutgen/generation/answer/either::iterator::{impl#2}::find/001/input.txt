self is of type Either<L, R> with L and R being valid iterator types, predicate is a function that takes an item of type L::Item and returns a boolean, and the function must be invoked when Either<R> is populated and contains at least one item matching the predicate; edge cases include an empty iterator or iterators with only non-matching items.
