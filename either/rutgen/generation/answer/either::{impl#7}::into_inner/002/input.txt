self is an instance of Either with both Left and Right variants containing values of type T, valid types for T could be any numeric type (e.g., i32, u32, f64), and the values in both variants should be the same type as they are equivalent; the test should cover values including positive, negative, zero, and edge cases like minimum and maximum values of the type T, ensuring tested input can include both variants being called with different values as a contrast.
