Test input conditions or ranges: Self must be a type that can be serialized and deserialized (e.g., u8, String, custom struct implementing serde traits); into_left function must be a closure that accepts a reference to Self and returns a bool, should validate with both true and false outcomes for a variety of Self values including edge cases like u8(0), u8(1), and maximum/minimum values.
