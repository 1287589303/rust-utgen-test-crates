self is Either::Right and requires an `iter` input of type T that can be converted into an iterator yielding type A, where T can also handle an empty iterator and a variety of item counts (1 to N) including boundary cases like passing a single item, multiple items, and an iterator that does not yield any items (0 items) while ensuring A can be of any type compatible with R in Either<R, L>.
