self should be of type Either<L, R> where L is a type that can be passed to function F and R is a type that can be passed to function G, covering cases where Either is instantiated as Left(L), such as Left(0), Left(1), Left(MAX_U32), and other values within the bounds of L's type, as well as testing with diverse function types for F and G.
