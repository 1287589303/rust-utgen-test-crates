self must be a valid non-empty Slice<T> instance, b must be a value of type B that is comparable using Ord, and F must be a function that takes a reference to T and returns a value of type B; test input ranges should include various sizes of Slice<T> (including edge cases like one and two elements), different values of b (found, less than, greater than elements in the Slice), and function f defined with different comparison criteria (identity, transformation).
