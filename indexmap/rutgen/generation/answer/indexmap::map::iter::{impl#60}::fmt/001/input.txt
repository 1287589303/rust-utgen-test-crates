Test input conditions or ranges: A valid `Values` struct with an iterator over at least one `Bucket<K, V>` instance, a valid `fmt::Formatter` instance, and various key-value pairs such that keys are of type `K` and values are of type `V` that implement `fmt::Debug`, including edge cases of empty Buckets and maximum allowed size of Buckets to test boundary conditions.
