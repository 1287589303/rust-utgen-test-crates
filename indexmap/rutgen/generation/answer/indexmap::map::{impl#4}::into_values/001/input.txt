Test input conditions or ranges: K and V types should be valid and non-empty; for `self`, an IndexMap with at least 1 element (key-value pairs); ensure hash_builder is valid; test with various values of K and V including edge cases like integers, strings, and composite types to validate ordering and correctness of the returned IntoValues.
