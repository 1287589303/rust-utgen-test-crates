- Test input conditions should include: a mutable reference to an IndexMapCore instance, various vector sizes from 0 up to MAX_ENTRIES_CAPACITY for 'self.entries', and a closure (F) that performs operations on an empty vector, a vector with one entry, and vectors filled to or near the maximum capacity, ensuring the closure modifies entries and checks for appropriate behavior.
