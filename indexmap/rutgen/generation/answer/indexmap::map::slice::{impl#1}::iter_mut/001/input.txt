- Test input conditions: `self.entries` should be a mutable slice with varying lengths including empty (`[]`), single-element (`[Bucket]`), and multi-element (`[Bucket, Bucket, ...]`) cases, across different types for `K` and `V` (e.g., integers, strings), and check for the iterator's behavior on these inputs.
