Test input conditions or ranges: A mutable reference to an `IndexMap` instance containing at least 1 key-value pair of type `(K, V)` where `K` implements `Hash` and `Eq`, and `V` is mutable; a closure `keep` that returns a boolean for at least one element, testing both true and false returns, including cases where all elements are retained and none are retained.
