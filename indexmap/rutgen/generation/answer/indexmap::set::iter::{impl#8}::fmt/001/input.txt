Iter<'a, T> instance should be created with a non-empty slice of Bucket<T> elements for T being any type that implements fmt::Debug; the fmt::Formatter argument should be valid and mutable, ensuring it can handle a range of key-value pairs (including edge cases where Bucket list is of size 0, 1, 2, and maximum allowed size), covering scenarios where T can be primitive types, structs, or enums with appropriate Debug implementations.
