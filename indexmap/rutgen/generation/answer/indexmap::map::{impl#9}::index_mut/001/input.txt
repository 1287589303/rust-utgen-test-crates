Test input conditions or ranges: Ensure that the key exists in the map (i.e., any key that has been previously inserted and is still present), test with key types of both existing and non-existing keys, accommodate for empty map state, and validate with various data types for keys supported by Hash and Equivalent traits within the context of `IndexMap`.
