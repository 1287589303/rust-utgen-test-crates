Valid key types that implement Hash and Equivalent traits, where the map contains at least one entry with a corresponding key that is not null or undefined, yet results in an existing index being used in `get_index_of` and returning a mutable reference to the associated value, while covering edge cases such as an empty map, a map with one element, and a map where the keys are at the maximum possible length/complexity.
