- The first input (`self`) should be an instance of `IndexSet<T, S1>` with at least one element, where `T` implements `Eq`, `Hash`, and `Clone`, and `S1` is a `BuildHasher` type; the second input (`other`) should be an instance of `IndexSet<T, S2>` with at least one element, where `S2` is also a `BuildHasher`, thereby covering cases of both empty and non-empty sets, and variations in hash functions.
