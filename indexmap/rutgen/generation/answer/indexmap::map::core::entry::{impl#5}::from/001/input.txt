test input conditions: Valid `IndexedEntry` with a non-empty `entries` array, valid `index` within the bounds of the `entries` array, `indices` containing an entry for the hash value returned by `hash.get()`, and `index` being present in `indices` for edge cases such as empty and full states of `entries`.
