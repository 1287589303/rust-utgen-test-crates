The test input conditions or ranges for the `swap_remove` function include: 
- A valid reference to an `IndexMapCore<K, V>` with at least one entry present, ensuring the `swap_remove` operation can occur successfully (i.e., the map is not empty).
- An `IndexedEntry` instance created with a valid index (0 to size of the map - 1) to ensure the index is within bounds for the `swap_remove` operation.
- Variants of `K` and `V` that can be swapped and removed from the map without causing panic, ensuring both types are properly implementable and display expected behavior during removal. 
- Testing the function's behavior when called on an `IndexedEntry` that represents the last index of the map to validate boundary condition handling. 
- Additionally, considering cases where the map contains only one entry to affirm correct behavior during the edge case of removing the sole entry.
