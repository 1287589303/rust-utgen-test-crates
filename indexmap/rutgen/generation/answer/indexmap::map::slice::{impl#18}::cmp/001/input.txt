Input conditions: 
- Self and other must be instances of Slice with the same type parameters K and V, where K is ordered (e.g. integers or strings) and the number of entries in both slices must be the same or at least one slice must be empty to cover the edge case of comparison between empty and non-empty slices; the entries must contain distinct keys to avoid ambiguity in ordering.
