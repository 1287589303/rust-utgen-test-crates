The inputs for the `partial_cmp` function should include two `Slice<T>` instances where `T` is a type that implements `PartialOrd`, with scenarios including:
1. Both slices are empty.
2. One slice is empty, and the other is non-empty.
3. Both slices contain the same elements in the same order.
4. Both slices contain the same elements in different orders.
5. The first slice contains elements that are less than the second slice.
6. The first slice contains elements that are greater than the second slice.
7. Edge case: slices with one element each where elements are equal.
8. Edge case: slices with one element each where elements are not equal.
9. Both slices are of different lengths but have overlapping values.
10. Both slices have no overlapping values.
