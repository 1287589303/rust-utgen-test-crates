Valid values for key: non-null, unique keys of type K not previously in map; Valid values for value: non-null value of type V; Valid hash values: computed from keys ensuring they respect the map's constraints; Edge cases: inserting into an empty map, inserting at maximum capacity, and inserting duplicate keys.
