Test input conditions or ranges: self and other should be IndexSet instances with the same number of elements (len() > 0), T must implement Hash and Eq, both IndexSets should contain equivalent elements, and ensure at least one identity case where both are equal (e.g., both are empty sets or both contain the same elements).
