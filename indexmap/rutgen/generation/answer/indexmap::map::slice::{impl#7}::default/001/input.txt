Test input conditions or ranges: Test with an empty array of `Bucket<K, V>`, a single `Bucket<K, V>`, and an array of multiple `Bucket<K, V>` elements, ensuring to cover cases with different key-value pairs and boundary conditions (minimum size of 0 and maximum reasonable size based on system memory).
