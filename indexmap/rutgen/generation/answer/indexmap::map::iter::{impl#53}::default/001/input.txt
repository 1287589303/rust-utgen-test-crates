K and V types can be any types that implement the necessary traits; test input ranges include scenarios where K and V are null, empty, single element, and multiple elements (1, 10, 100) where the bucket could contain both unique and duplicate hash values; also include tests for both primitives and complex types (like structs or enums) as keys and values.
