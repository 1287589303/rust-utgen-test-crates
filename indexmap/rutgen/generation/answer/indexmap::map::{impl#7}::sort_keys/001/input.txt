Test input conditions or ranges: Test with an empty `IndexMap`, an `IndexMap` with one entry, an `IndexMap` with multiple entries where keys are unsorted, keys in ascending order, keys in descending order, and keys with mixed types (e.g., integers and strings), ensuring that all keys implement the `Ord` trait.
