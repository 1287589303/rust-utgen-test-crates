0 <= index < MAX_ENTRIES_CAPACITY, where MAX_ENTRIES_CAPACITY is the maximum number of entries the IndexMap can hold based on the Bucket size and is defined as (isize::MAX as usize) / mem::size_of::<Bucket<K, V>>; additionally test with index equal to 0, index equal to len()-1, and out of bounds indices for robust boundary testing.
