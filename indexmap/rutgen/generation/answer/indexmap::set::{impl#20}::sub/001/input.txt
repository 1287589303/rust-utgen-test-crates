Test input conditions or ranges: `self` is a non-empty `IndexSet<T, S1>` with at least one element (where T is Eq + Hash + Clone), `other` is an `IndexSet<T, S2>` that could be empty or non-empty, both should use compatible hashers with default implementations, and T should not include types that might result in unequal or invalid hashes.
