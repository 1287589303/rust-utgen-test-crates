Validating `insert_unique` with test inputs: `hash` values in range [0, 2^64-1], `key` type must implement `Hash`, `value` type must be compatible, `self.indices` and `self.entries` must be initialized with matching lengths, `indices` capacity should be non-zero to allow insertion, and verify behavior when capacity equals current entries length before and after insertion.
