Test input conditions or ranges: non-negative integers for the initial capacity of the IndexSet (e.g., 0, 1, 10, 100), invoke `shrink_to_fit` when the set is empty, when it contains a few elements (e.g., 1 to 10), and when it is at maximum capacity, including edge cases of exactly matching the internal capacity and exceeding it.
