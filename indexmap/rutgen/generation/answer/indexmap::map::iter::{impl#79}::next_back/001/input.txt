Iterator `drain` should be initialized with various ranges of `Bucket<K, V>` where `K` is hashable and `V` can be any type, including cases where `drain` is empty, with some examples being: 
- `drain` containing a single `Bucket<K, V>` 
- `drain` having multiple `Bucket<K, V>`  
- `drain` being empty (`Vec::new()`) 
- `K` being a type that hashes to the same value (e.g., strings or integers, to test collision handling).
