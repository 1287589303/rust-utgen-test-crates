Valid inputs for `self.index()` and `to` must be within the range of the number of entries in the map (0 to the length of entries minus one), and `to` must not equal `self.index()`. Edge cases include `to` equal to 0, `to` equal to the number of entries minus one, and `to` equal to the index + 1 or index - 1. Input conditions range from `0` to `number_of_entries - 1` for `self.index()` and all values excluding `self.index()` for `to`.
