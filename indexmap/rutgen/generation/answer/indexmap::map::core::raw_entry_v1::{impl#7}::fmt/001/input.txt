Occupy an entry with valid `K` and `V` types, ensure `entries` is mutable and initialized, test with various sizes of entries (including 0, 1, and maximum allowed), test for boundaries of valid indices (0 and size of entries - 1), and use edge cases with unusually large or small values for `K` and `V`.
