- The function with_entries requires a mutable reference to an IndexSet or having at least one entry in it (non-empty) and a callable function f that takes a mutable reference to a slice of Bucket entries; thus, the test inputs should include an IndexSet with varying numbers of entries (0, 1, and multiple entries), and various callable functions (e.g., modifying each entry, filtering entries, no-operation functions) to cover edge cases and functionalities.
