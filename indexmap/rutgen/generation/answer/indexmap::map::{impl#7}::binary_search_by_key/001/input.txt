1. Non-empty collections with unique keys for various key-value types (K, V) and sorting behaviors, including boundary cases for smallest and largest entries.
2. Sorted and unsorted collections to test behavior across a variety of ordering scenarios.
3. Key types (B) that are comparable with both existing and non-existing keys to evaluate positional return values.
4. Key-value pairs where the sorting function (F) handles both equal and different values of K and V to observe correct insertion positions.
5. Collections containing zero to many elements to assess performance and return values across different sizes, including edge cases (1, 2, maximal sizes).
