Valid test input conditions or ranges: key of type K (e.g., strings, integers, custom objects implementing Hash and Eq), value of type V (e.g., strings, integers, custom objects), input key should include existing key in the map (to test update scenario) and non-existing key (to test insertion scenario), ensure to test with boundary keys such as minimum and maximum values for type K, and test with varying hash builders (S) including default and custom hashers.
