- Range must be valid with start less than or equal to end, start greater than or equal to zero, and end less than or equal to the length of the IndexMap. Test cases should include: (0, length), (0, 0), (length-1, length), (1, length), (0, length-1), (0, 1), (length, length) to check for panic conditions, and both valid ranges and empty states.
