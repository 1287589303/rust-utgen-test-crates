Both `IndexMap<K, V, S>` and `IndexMap<K, V, S2>` must have non-overlapping keys for simple append, overlapping keys for value updating, and allow various data types for keys and values, including edge cases of empty maps and maps with maximum size constraints; boundary cases include appending a map with one entry, maximum capacity, and different key types that implement `Hash + Eq` and `Ord`.
