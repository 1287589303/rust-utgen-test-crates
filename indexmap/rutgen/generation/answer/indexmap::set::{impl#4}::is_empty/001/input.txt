The test input conditions or ranges should include: 
1. An empty `IndexSet<T, S>` after creation (should return true for `is_empty()`).
2. An `IndexSet<T, S>` with multiple elements added (should return false for `is_empty()`).
3. An `IndexSet<T, S>` where elements are removed, leading to an empty set (should return true for `is_empty()`).
4. An `IndexSet<T, S>` initialized with a capacity greater than zero but not filled (should return false for `is_empty()` if elements are added).
5. An `IndexSet<T, S>` created with zero capacity and then filled (should return false for `is_empty()` once elements are added).
