Input array must contain at least one element of type T that implements Eq and Hash, with a maximum size of N elements. The array can consist of duplicates (to test uniqueness), and the range of T should include typical values, edge values like minimum and maximum integers, and a mix of positive and negative numbers if appropriate.
