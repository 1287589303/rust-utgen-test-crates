Test input conditions or ranges: input a sorted collection of elements of type T, including edge cases of an empty collection, a single element, a collection where all elements satisfy the predicate, and a collection where no elements satisfy the predicate; use various predicates such as always true, always false, and conditions that change at the boundaries of the collection.
