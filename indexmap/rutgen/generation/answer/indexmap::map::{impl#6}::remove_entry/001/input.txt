Valid test input conditions include:
- Key type `K` that is hashable and implements `Equivalent<K>`
- A mutable reference to an `IndexMap<K, V, S>` with at least one entry
- A key `key` that exists in the map (valid case)
- A key `key` that does not exist in the map (invalid case)
- Test with minimum, maximum, and average sizes of the map (empty, one entry, multiple entries)
- Test with different data types for `K` and `V` (e.g., integers, strings, custom structs)
- Edge cases such as removing the last entry, or attempting to remove from an empty map
