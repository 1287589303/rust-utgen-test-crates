Key must be a hashable type, value must be a mutable reference type (e.g., owning type), hash_builder must be an instance of BuildHasher, and valid inputs must ensure that the map is in a state that can accept new entries (e.g., not full or restricted). Edge cases include empty key/value, maximum size limit, and special character handling.
