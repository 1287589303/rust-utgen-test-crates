1. K must implement the Ord trait; test with both comparable keys and non-comparable keys (e.g., integers, strings, custom structs).
2. The input slice must be sorted; test with sorted slices, reverse sorted slices, and slices not sorted at all.
3. The input slice should cover boundary cases, including empty slices, slices with one element, and large slices (e.g., sizes like 0, 1, 1000).
4. Test searching for keys that are present in the slice (should return the index) and keys that are not present (should return the insertion index).
5. Test with duplicate keys in the slice and verify the behavior when searching for these keys.
