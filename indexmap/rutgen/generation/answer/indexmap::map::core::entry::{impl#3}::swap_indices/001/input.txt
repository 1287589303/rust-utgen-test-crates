self must be a valid OccupiedEntry instance, other must be a valid index within the bounds of the entries array, and self.index() must return an index that is also within the bounds of the entries array; thus, valid test input conditions are: self as a valid OccupiedEntry<K, V> instance and other as an integer in the range [0, entries.len() - 1] where entries is the array of entries associated with self.
