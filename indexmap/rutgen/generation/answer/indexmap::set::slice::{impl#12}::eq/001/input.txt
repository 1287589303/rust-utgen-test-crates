Self must be an instance of Slice<T>, and other must be a reference to an array of length N with elements of type U that are comparable to T, ensuring that T implements PartialEq for the comparison. Valid input ranges for N are natural numbers, and T must have values that can either be equal to or not equal the corresponding elements in the provided array to check both true and false scenarios.
