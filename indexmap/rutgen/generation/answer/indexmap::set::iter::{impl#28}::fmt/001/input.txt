The input conditions should include a Difference instance with varying types T (e.g., integers, strings) and S (e.g., different hashers), ensuring T implements Debug, Eq, and Hash traits, with at least one Difference instance being empty, and at least one populated with distinct and overlapping elements with IndexSet, to test the formatting behavior across various configurations including edge cases like maximum lengths and empty sets.
