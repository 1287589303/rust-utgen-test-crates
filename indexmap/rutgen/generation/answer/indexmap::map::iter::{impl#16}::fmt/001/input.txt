- Test with an empty `IterMut` instance (self.iter being an empty slice).
- Test with a single-item `IterMut` instance (self.iter containing one `Bucket`).
- Test with a multi-item `IterMut` instance (self.iter containing multiple `Buckets`).
- Test with `Bucket` keys and values being of different types (e.g., strings and integers).
- Test with `Bucket` keys and values that implement `fmt::Debug` trait to ensure proper formatting.
- Test with `IterMut` instances representing the maximum size of the underlying collection.
- Test with `fmt::Formatter` instances in various states (default, custom outputs for boundaries).
