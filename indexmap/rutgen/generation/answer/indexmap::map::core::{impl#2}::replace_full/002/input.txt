self.indices should contain at least one entry with a hash that does not equal hash.get() for the key K provided, input K values should be distinct and not equal to any existing keys in the entries, hash should be a valid HashValue object, value should be of type V, K should implement Eq, and the test should consider edge cases like inserting when entries are empty, when a single entry already exists, and when the maximum entries capacity is reached.
