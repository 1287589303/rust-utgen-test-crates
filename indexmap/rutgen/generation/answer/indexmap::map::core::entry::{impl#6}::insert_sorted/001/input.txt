Valid input ranges for testing the `insert_sorted` function include:
- K (key) must implement Ord trait and support comparison for sorting; test with both valid and edge cases (e.g., empty, single, and multiple entries)
- V (value) can be any valid type
- Ensure the entries in `self.map.entries` are already sorted and test with unsorted entries as well
- Use boundary condition tests with maximum and minimum sizes for `self.map.entries`, including cases of 0, 1, and 2 entries 
- Test with duplicate keys which might require unique handling in insertion logic
