T is a type that implements Eq and Hash; S is a builder for hashing algorithms; the input conditions include non-empty and empty IndexSets, varying numbers of elements in the IndexSet for different combinations of T and S, edge cases for maximum size of IndexSet, and at least one scenario where Union iterates over both non-empty and empty sets.
