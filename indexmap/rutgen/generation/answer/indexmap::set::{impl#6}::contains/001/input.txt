type of T being checked in IndexSet<T, S> can be any hashable type | Q can be any reference to a type that implements Hash and Equivalent<T> | Test with typical T values (like integers, strings) | Edge cases where T is empty or contains minimal entries | Test with Q being exactly identical, similar but different types, and edge cases with null or non-existent entries | Test for performance with large sets and varying sizes of T | Validate against custom hashers by varying S.
