Test input conditions or ranges: K and V types must implement fmt::Debug; `self.iter` should contain at least one `Bucket<K, V>` to test `fmt` method behavior properly; boundary cases include an empty `iter`, and iterators containing edge cases of hash collisions (e.g., multiple Buckets with the same hash).
