self.entries must be a non-empty array of Bucket<T> structures and other must be a non-empty array of U elements with the same length as self.entries; both must contain at least one element; bucket keys must be comparable to U; boundary cases include arrays of length 0 (should return false), arrays of length 1 with matching and non-matching keys, and arrays with differing lengths.
