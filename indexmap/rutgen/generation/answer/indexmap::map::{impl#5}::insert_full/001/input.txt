Key: any hashable type; Value: any type; expected output: tuple of (usize, Option<V>); for K: specify various types including capacity edge cases (e.g., 0, 1, MAX_ENTRIES_CAPACITY); for V: include empty, non-empty, and larger data types; test behavior with existing and new keys, and iterate over varying key-value pairs.
