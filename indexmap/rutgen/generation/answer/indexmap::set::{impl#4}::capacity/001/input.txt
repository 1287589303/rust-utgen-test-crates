Valid inputs for `capacity` should include a state where the `IndexSet` is initialized with various capacities, specifically testing with capacities of 0, 1, and any large positive integer (e.g., 1000) using different hash builders; also verify after adding elements to ensure it reflects current capacities post-modifications.
