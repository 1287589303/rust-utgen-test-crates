For the `sort_by` function, the inferred test input conditions or ranges are:
- A mutable reference to an `IndexMap<K, V, S>` containing at least one entry where `K` implements `Ord`, and valid comparison function `cmp` that takes two key-value pairs and returns an `Ordering`. Test also with empty map, single entry, and edge case with maximum `usize` entries.
