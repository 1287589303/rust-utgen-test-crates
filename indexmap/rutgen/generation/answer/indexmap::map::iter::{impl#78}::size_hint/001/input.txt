The `size_hint` function should be tested with various scenarios including: an empty `drain` (0 elements), a `drain` with a single element (1 element), a `drain` with multiple elements (2 to N elements), a `drain` that is at its maximum capacity if applicable. Ensure to check boundary cases by including an iterator just before and at the limit of its capacity, along with scenarios where the iterator can yield maximum size and minimum size hints for all ranges of input including empty and full conditions.
