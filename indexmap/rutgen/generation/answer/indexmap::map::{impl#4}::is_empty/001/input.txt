self is an instance of IndexMap with any combination of K, V, and S, including empty and non-empty states. Test input should range from an empty IndexMap (len = 0) to an IndexMap with varying non-zero lengths (len = 1, 10, 100, etc.), ensuring the method returns true for empty and false for non-empty instances.
