The key input conditions for testing binary_search_by_key include: 
- A non-empty `Slice<K, V>` with a sorted order based on key comparisons.
- Various types of keys `K` that implement `Ord`, including edge cases like maximum and minimum values.
- Values `V` can be of any type, but the provided extraction function must correctly transform keys and values into a comparable type `B` that also implements `Ord`.
- Input for `b` should include values present in the slice, as well as values less than and greater than existing keys to test both found and insertion positions.
- The function should be tested for boundary cases, including:
  - Searching the first key (smallest).
  - Searching the last key (largest).
  - Searching a key that is less than the first key.
  - Searching a key that is greater than the last key.
  - Searching keys that are equal to existing keys to ensure proper position is returned.
