Key must be of a type that implements Hash and Equivalent<K>, and must be a non-None reference; the hasher type must implement BuildHasher; valid hash values to test ranges should include edge cases (e.g., 0, maximum value for the hash type, and typical mid-range values); input key types must include various sizes, shapes, and equivalent conditions including edge cases for equivalence, ensuring the map has both occupied and vacant entries for testing.
