Input conditions: 
- T must be a type that implements the Hash and Eq traits; 
- S1 and S2 must be valid hash builders; 
- IndexSet<T, S1> and IndexSet<T, S2> should be instantiated with at least one element to ensure there is a symmetric difference; 
- Test cases where IndexSet<T, S1> and IndexSet<T, S2> are identical to expect None as output; 
- Edge cases where one IndexSet is empty and the other is not; 
- At least one element in either IndexSet for non-None output; 
- Sizes of both IndexSets varying from 0 (empty) to their maximum allowable sizes; 
- Ensure varying types of T to explore the effects on the symmetric difference.
