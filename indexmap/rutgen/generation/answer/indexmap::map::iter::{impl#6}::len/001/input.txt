len() function should be tested with Iter instances containing Buckets with varying numbers of elements: 
1. An empty Iter instance (0 elements)
2. An Iter instance with a single Bucket (1 element)
3. An Iter instance with multiple Buckets (e.g., 2, 5, 10 elements)
4. An Iter instance at maximum expected capacity (if defined)
5. An Iter instance with the highest supported K and V types within the context of IndexMap (extreme type cases)
Make sure to test scenarios that challenge the edges of the underlying slice's capabilities, including scenarios with minimal and maximal lengths.
