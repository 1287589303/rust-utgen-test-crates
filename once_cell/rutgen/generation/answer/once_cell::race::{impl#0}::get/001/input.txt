Test input conditions or ranges: AtomicUsize initialized to 0 (to check handling of absence of NonZeroUsize), AtomicUsize initialized to 1 (minimum NonZeroUsize), and AtomicUsize initialized to any positive integer to confirm expected NonZeroUsize results (1 to maximum possible NonZeroUsize value according to architecture).
