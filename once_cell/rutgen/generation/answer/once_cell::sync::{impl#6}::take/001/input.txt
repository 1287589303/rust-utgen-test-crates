OnceCell with no initialized value and type T (e.g., `OnceCell<String>` or `OnceCell<u32>`) and ones with initialized values (e.g., `OnceCell::new().set("test".to_string()).unwrap()`) spanning various types such as Strings, integers, and types that implement the Copy trait; test inputs should cover uninitialized state, initialized state, and different data types including boundary values (like empty strings) and various numeric ranges (positive, negative, zero), ensuring all possible scenarios including edge cases are accounted for.
