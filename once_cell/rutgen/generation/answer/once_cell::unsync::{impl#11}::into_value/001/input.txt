Lazy<T, F> initialized with a function F, where T can be any type, and test conditions include: F = valid function returning T, F = function returning T with panics, and F = function returning non-initialized state; additionally test with: Lazy<T, F> not initialized, Lazy<T, F> previously poisoned, Lazy<T, F> initialized with non-default types (e.g., Option<T>, Box<T>), and check return types for Result<T, F>.
