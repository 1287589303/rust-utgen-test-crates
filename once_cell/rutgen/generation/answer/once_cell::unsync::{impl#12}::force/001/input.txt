Valid input conditions or ranges are: `Lazy<T, F>` should be created with a valid function `F` that returns a value of type `T`, where `T` can be a numeric, string, or custom type, and `F` is a function that is callable; ensure the Lazy instance is not previously poisoned, and validate behavior on first call and subsequent calls to `force` while checking state with no initialized value (i.e., None).
