Test input conditions or ranges: Test with Lazy<T, F> instances where T includes primitive types (e.g., i32, str), composite types (e.g., structs implementing Debug), and F includes both valid function pointers and invalid/uninitialized states; also test with initialized and uninitialized OnceCell<T> instances.
