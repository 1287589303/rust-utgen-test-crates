self and other should be instances of OnceCell holding the same or different types that implement PartialEq; T can be any type that implements PartialEq, including primitive types (e.g., i32, f64), and non-primitive types (e.g., String, CustomStruct) with possible None values, tested with cases where both cells are None, both cells hold values, and one cell holds None while the other holds a value.
