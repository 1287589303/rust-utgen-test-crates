&mut Lazy<T, F> where T can be any type including:
- Uninitialized state for Lazy<T, F>
- Initialized with a simple type (e.g., i32, f64)
- Initialized with a complex type (e.g., String, Vec<T>)
- Mutably accessed after initialization with the expected type T
- Ensure the function is tested with and without prior initialization 
- Edge case where `Lazy` is initialized with a closure that returns none or panics
