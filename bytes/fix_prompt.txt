[299]/// another language (normally C). This can run arbitrary Rust code, capturing a
[300]/// panic and allowing a graceful handling of the error.
[301]///
[302]/// It is **not** recommended to use this function for a general try/catch
[303]/// mechanism. The [`Result`] type is more appropriate to use for functions that
[304]/// can fail on a regular basis. Additionally, this function is not guaranteed
[305]/// to catch all panics, see the "Notes" section below.
[306]///
[307]/// The closure provided is required to adhere to the [`UnwindSafe`] trait to ensure
[308]/// that all captured variables are safe to cross this boundary. The purpose of
[309]/// this bound is to encode the concept of [exception safety][rfc] in the type
[310]/// system. Most usage of this function should not need to worry about this
[311]/// bound as programs are naturally unwind safe without `unsafe` code. If it
[312]/// becomes a problem the [`AssertUnwindSafe`] wrapper struct can be used to quickly
[313]/// assert that the usage here is indeed unwind safe.
[314]///

[316]///
[317]/// # Notes
[318]///
[319]/// Note that this function **might not catch all panics** in Rust. A panic in
[320]/// Rust is not always implemented via unwinding, but can be implemented by
[321]/// aborting the process as well. This function *only* catches unwinding panics,
[322]/// not those that abort the process.
[323]///
[324]/// Note that if a custom panic hook has been set, it will be invoked before
[325]/// the panic is caught, before unwinding.
[326]///
[327]/// Also note that unwinding into Rust code with a foreign exception (e.g.
[328]/// an exception thrown from C++ code) is undefined behavior.
[329]///
[330]/// Finally, be **careful in how you drop the result of this function**.
[331]/// If it is `Err`, it contains the panic payload, and dropping that may in turn panic!
[332]///
[333]/// # Examples
[334]///
[335]/// ```
[336]/// use std::panic;
[337]///
[338]/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
[339]///     println!("hello!");
[340]/// });
[341]/// assert!(result.is_ok());
[342]///
[343]/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
[344]///     panic!("oh no!");
[345]/// });
[346]/// assert!(result.is_err());
[347]/// ```

[352]
[353]/// Triggers a panic without invoking the panic hook.
[354]///
[355]/// This is designed to be used in conjunction with [`catch_unwind`] to, for
[356]/// example, carry a panic across a layer of C code.
[357]///
[358]/// # Notes
[359]///
[360]/// Note that panics in Rust are not always implemented via unwinding, but they
[361]/// may be implemented by aborting the process. If this function is called when
[362]/// panics are implemented this way then this function will abort the process,
[363]/// not trigger an unwind.
[364]///
[365]/// # Examples
[366]///
[367]/// ```should_panic
[368]/// use std::panic;
[369]///
[370]/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
[371]///     panic!("oh no!");
[372]/// });
[373]///
[374]/// if let Err(err) = result {
[375]///     panic::resume_unwind(err);
[376]/// }
[377]/// ```

[379]pub fn resume_unwind(payload: Box<dyn Any + Send>) -> ! {
[380]    panicking::rust_panic_without_hook(payload)
[381]}
[382]
[383]/// Make all future panics abort directly without running the panic hook or unwinding.
[384]///
[385]/// There is no way to undo this; the effect lasts until the process exits or
[386]/// execs (or the equivalent).
[387]///
[388]/// # Use after fork
[389]///
[390]/// This function is particularly useful for calling after `libc::fork`.  After `fork`, in a
[391]/// multithreaded program it is (on many platforms) not safe to call the allocator.  It is also
[392]/// generally highly undesirable for an unwind to unwind past the `fork`, because that results in
[393]/// the unwind propagating to code that was only ever expecting to run in the parent.
[394]///
[395]/// `panic::always_abort()` helps avoid both of these.  It directly avoids any further unwinding,
[396]/// and if there is a panic, the abort will occur without allocating provided that the arguments to
[397]/// panic can be formatted without allocating.
[398]///
[399]/// Examples
Instructions: Fix the error on the above code snippets. Not every snippet might require a fix or be relevant to the error, but take into account the code in all above snippets as it could help you derive the best possible fix. Assume that the snippets might not be complete and could be missing lines above or below. Do not add comments or code that is not necessary to fix the error. Do not use unsafe or unstable features (through ’#![feature(...)]’). You can only modify lines 2971 to 2978 in file /home/abezbm/rust-utgen-test-crates/bytes/src/buf/buf_impl.rs. For your answer, return one or more ChangeLog groups, each containing one or more fixes to the above code snippets. Each group must be formatted with the below instructions.Format instructions: Each ChangeLog group must start with a description of its included fixes. The group must then list one or more pairs of (OriginalCode, FixedCode) code snippets. Each OriginalCode snippet must list all consecutive original lines of code that must be replaced (including a few lines before and after the fixes), followed by the FixedCode snippet with all consecutive fixed lines of code that must replace the original lines of code (including the same few lines before and after the changes). In each pair, the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets must start at the same source code line number N. Each listed code line, in both the OriginalCode and FixedCode snippets, must be prefixed with [N] that matches the line index N in the above snippets, and then be prefixed with exactly the same whitespace indentation as the original snippets above.
