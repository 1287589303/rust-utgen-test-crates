Test input conditions or ranges: Two instances of types implementing BufMut with varying sizes for remaining_mut() returning values including 0 (empty), 1 (single remaining byte), and maximum representable values based on system architecture for both instances, covering cases where one or both instances have zero remaining bytes and ensuring all combinations are tested, including large and small sizes respectively.
