ptr must be a valid non-null pointer to a memory region and len must be a non-negative integer less than or equal to the size of the memory region pointed to by ptr. Valid input would require ptr to be non-null, len to be in the range [0, max], where max is the maximum allowed size of the memory region, ensuring that slice::from_raw_parts does not cause undefined behavior.
