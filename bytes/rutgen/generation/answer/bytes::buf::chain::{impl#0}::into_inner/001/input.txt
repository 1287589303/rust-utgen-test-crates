Test input conditions or ranges: T and U can be any types that are compatible for the Chain structure, including but not limited to: (slice of bytes, slice of strings), (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>), (String, String), (Option<T>, Option<U>), and boundary cases such as empty slices, minimum size for types, and maximum size for types in a plausible application context.
