valid input ranges for T and U include any non-owning buffer types that implement corresponding traits (e.g., slices, vectors) and cases where T is empty and U is non-empty, or vice versa, ensuring at least one of a or b is non-empty; test empty cases and maximum size cases for T and U if applicable
