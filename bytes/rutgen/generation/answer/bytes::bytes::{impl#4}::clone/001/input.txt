test input conditions: valid `Bytes` instances with varying lengths (0 to N where N is a large positive integer), null pointer scenarios, atomic data states (unique vs non-unique), and correctness of returned `Bytes` after cloning across different `vtable` types (OWNED, PROMOTABLE_EVEN, PROMOTABLE_ODD, SHARED, STATIC).
