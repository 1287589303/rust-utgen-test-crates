The `put_i32` function should be tested with conditions where there is enough remaining capacity in `self` to write 4 bytes, specifically testing edge cases such as exactly 4 bytes remaining, less than 4 bytes (which should cause a panic), and more than 4 bytes. Valid integer inputs for `n` should range from the minimum to the maximum values for a signed 32-bit integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
