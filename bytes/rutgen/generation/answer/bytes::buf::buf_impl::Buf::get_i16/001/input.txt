- The buffer must have at least 2 bytes available; valid test input ranges for the input buffer are from 2 bytes up to any size (e.g., 2 to N bytes); expected return values are signed 16-bit integers within the range of -32,768 to 32,767; test should include edge cases of exactly 2 bytes, large buffers, and buffers with non-integer values.
