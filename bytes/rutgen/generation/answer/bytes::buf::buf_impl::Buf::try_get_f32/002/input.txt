The input conditions need to ensure that the buffer has at least 4 bytes available for successful retrieval, with edge cases including exactly 4 bytes and less than 4 bytes for failure scenarios; hence the ranges are: buffer sizes of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and greater than 4 bytes, with varying content types including valid and invalid bytes for float conversion.
