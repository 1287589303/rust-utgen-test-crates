% Test input conditions or ranges for the function static_to_vec: ptr must be a non-null valid pointer to allocated memory, len must be a non-negative usize value, and ptr + len must not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory. Ensure testing with len as 0 (boundary case), minimum value of 1, and lengths greater than typical byte buffer sizes such as 256, 512, 1024.
