Test cases should cover the following conditions: buffer with at least 4 bytes remaining, buffer exactly at 4 bytes remaining, buffer less than 4 bytes remaining (expect panic), valid f32 values including positive, negative, and zero, edge cases like f32::MIN, f32::MAX, f32::INFINITY, f32::NEG_INFINITY, and f32::NAN.
