1. The first buffer (self) must be mutable and of type implementing BufMut, with a minimum capacity of 5 bytes to accommodate the test case "hello".
2. The second buffer (next) must also be mutable and of type implementing BufMut, with a minimum capacity of 6 bytes to store the remaining " world".
3. The length of the slice input to put_slice should be at least 11 bytes (length of "hello world") to test the chaining behavior correctly.
4. The test should cover edge cases such as self being empty and next being empty, while keeping the total combined capacity at least the length of the slice input.
5. The resulting chained buffer from chain_mut should retain the integrity of the written data across both buffers after invoking put_slice.
