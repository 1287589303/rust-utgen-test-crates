Buffer must contain at least 4 bytes of data with proper byte alignment for the IEEE754 float representation to avoid panic, and test cases should include both big-endian and little-endian byte sequences representing valid and invalid float values, as well as boundary cases with exactly 4 bytes and fewer than 4 bytes.
