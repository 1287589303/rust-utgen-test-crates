The input conditions should ensure that the buffer has at least 8 bytes available for reading a double-precision floating point number in little-endian format, including cases where the buffer size is exactly 8 bytes, greater than 8 bytes, and less than 8 bytes to test for panics. The test input ranges are: buffer sizes of 0, 1-7 (for panic scenarios), 8 (minimum valid case), and greater than 8.
