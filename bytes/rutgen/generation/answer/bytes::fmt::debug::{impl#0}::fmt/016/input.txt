Input ranges for `self.0` must include a combination of byte values representing newline (b'\n'), carriage return (b'\r'), tab (b'\t'), backslash (b'\\'), and a variety of ASCII characters (0x20 to 0x7e), as well as non-printable bytes (0x00, 0x01 to 0x1f, and 0x80 to 0xff), while ensuring that b'\"' is excluded, ensuring that it should cover scenarios where the buffer is empty and contains only one type of escape as well as mixed bytes for comprehensive coverage.
