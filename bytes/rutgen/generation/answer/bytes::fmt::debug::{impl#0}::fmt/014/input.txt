Test input conditions or ranges: A byte array containing values including at least a newline (0x0A), carriage return (0x0D), tab (0x09), backslash (0x5C), non-printable ASCII characters (e.g., 0x00, 0x1F), and a mix of printable ASCII characters (0x20 to 0x7E), ensuring an overall length of 0 to 256 bytes for boundary testing.
