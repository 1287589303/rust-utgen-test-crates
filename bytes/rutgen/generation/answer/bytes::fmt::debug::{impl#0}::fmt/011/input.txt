Valid test input conditions or ranges: empty byte slice, byte slice including printable ASCII characters (0x20 to 0x7e), byte slice including special characters (e.g., b'\n', b'\r', b'\t', b'\\', b'"'), byte slice with non-printable characters (e.g., control characters, 0x00 to 0x1F, and greater than 0x7F), byte slice consisting of all the aforementioned characters in various combinations to cover all conditional branches, and specifically a single character slice containing b'\\' to validate the precondition of being false at line 23 and ensuring line 24 results in Err/None.
