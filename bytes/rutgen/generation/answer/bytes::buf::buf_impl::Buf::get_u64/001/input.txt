remaining bytes must be at least 8 for a valid call to get_u64; test cases should include buffer sizes of 0, 1-7, 8, and greater than 8, alongside various valid and edge case byte sequences, including non-aligned byte arrays, for both valid and invalid calls; expected outputs should align with big-endian interpretation or a panic scenario as necessary.
