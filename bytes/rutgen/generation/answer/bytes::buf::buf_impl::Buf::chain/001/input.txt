The inputs to the `chain` function should include a valid instance of a `Buf` implementing type for `self` and a valid `Buf` implementing type for `next`, where the combined length of both buffers is not exceeding the maximum allowable slice size. The chain should also consist of a non-empty slice for both `self` and `next`.
