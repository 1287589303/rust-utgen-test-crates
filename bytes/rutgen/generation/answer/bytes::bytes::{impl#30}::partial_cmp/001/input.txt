self must be a valid Bytes instance with a non-null pointer, other must be a valid String reference, and both must have non-negative lengths; test inputs: Bytes with len 0 to N (including edge cases of empty Bytes and single-byte Bytes) and String with lengths 0 to M (including edge cases of empty String and single-byte String).
