Valid static slice or owner with a length greater than zero, valid buffer values (e.g., u8 data range of 0 to 255), unique ownership scenario with a reference count of 1 or a clone scenario with a reference count of 2, inclusive lengths between 0 and maximum byte size (e.g., 1 to usize::MAX), and concurrent modification scenarios where applicable.
