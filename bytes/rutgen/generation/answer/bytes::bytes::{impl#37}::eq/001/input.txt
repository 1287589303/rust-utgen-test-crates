self must be a valid reference to a Bytes instance and other must be a valid reference to a type that implements PartialEq with Bytes, ensuring both instances are non-null and preferably have matching lengths for comparison; edge cases should include comparisons where one is empty, both are empty, and identical/non-identical data comparisons.
