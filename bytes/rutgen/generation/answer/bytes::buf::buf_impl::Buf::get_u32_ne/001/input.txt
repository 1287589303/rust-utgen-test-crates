The buffer must contain at least 4 bytes for valid extraction of a u32 value, and testing should include cases for exactly 4 bytes, fewer than 4 bytes, and more than 4 bytes, with checks for both little-endian and big-endian systems; valid byte sequences include 4-byte sequences that correspond to different u32 values (e.g., 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF).
