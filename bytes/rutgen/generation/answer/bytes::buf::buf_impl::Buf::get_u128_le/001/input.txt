Valid buffer length for tests: 0 to 16 bytes, with values for the 128-bit integer being in little-endian byte order; test cases must include exactly 16 bytes for successful calls, 0 to 15 bytes for panic scenarios, and include edge values like 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF for content.
