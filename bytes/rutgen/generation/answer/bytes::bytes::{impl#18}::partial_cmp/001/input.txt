self must be a valid Bytes instance with a specific length; other must be a valid slice of bytes with a length that can be compared; lengths of self and other should include boundary cases: 0 (empty), 1, 2, and lengths equal to that of self; include a test where self is empty and other is non-empty and vice versa; also test equal lengths with equal and unequal contents.
