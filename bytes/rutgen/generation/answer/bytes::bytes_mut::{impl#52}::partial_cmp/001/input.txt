self must be a &str with possible lengths of 0 to N (where N is any reasonable string length for tests), while other must be a BytesMut instance with len and cap values of 0 to M (where M is a reasonable upper limit for capacity). The expected return can be an Option<cmp::Ordering>, which would be None if self is empty, or some ordering if both inputs are non-empty.
