For the function `eq(&self, other: &&'a T)`, the test input conditions or ranges are: 

self: non-empty `BytesMut` instance, other: non-empty reference to a `Bytes` instance of the same length as `self`, both instances containing various byte values, including edge cases like empty, maximal length (cap), and different types (homogeneous and heterogeneous).
