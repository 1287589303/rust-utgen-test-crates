self.buf must be a mutable buffer type implementing BufMut that can hold varying sizes of data, ranging from 0 to a maximum limit; test with an empty buffer, a buffer with a single element, and buffers with sizes corresponding to powers of two (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., up to maximum buffer size supported by BufMut).
