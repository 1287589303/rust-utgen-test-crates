Valid input buffer sizes should include at least 8 bytes, while also testing with fewer than 8 bytes for boundary conditions; valid byte sequences include those that represent valid double-precision floating-point numbers in big-endian byte order, ensuring a non-zero distinction for tests involving not enough data, such as 0 to 7 bytes; confirm expected return types to be f64.
