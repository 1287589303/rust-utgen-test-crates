self should be a reference to a value of a type that implements the ToTokens trait, and tokens should be a mutable reference to a TokenStream object. The input conditions are: self type must be any type implementing ToTokens, such as bool, and tokens must be a mutable TokenStream instance initialized to an empty state.
