a: non-empty string (at least 2 characters); b: non-empty string (at least 2 characters); a_char and b_char are distinct; prev_b_char and prev_a_char are equal to characters from a and b respectively from the previous iteration; lengths of a and b should not exceed 100 characters to avoid performance issues.
