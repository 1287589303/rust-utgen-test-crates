Input strings 'a' and 'b' must be non-null and of varying lengths including empty strings, characters should be ASCII or Unicode, and the expected return value must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, to cover edge cases like exact matches, completely different strings, and one empty string against a non-empty string.
