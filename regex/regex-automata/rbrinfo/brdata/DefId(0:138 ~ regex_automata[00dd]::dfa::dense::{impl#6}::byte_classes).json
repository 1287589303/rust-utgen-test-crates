This has the effect of reducing the overall alphabet size\n/// and in turn potentially substantially reducing the size of the DFA's\n/// transition table.\n///\n/// The downside of using equivalence classes like this is that every state\n/// transition will automatically use this map to convert an arbitrary\n/// byte to its corresponding equivalence class. In practice this has a\n/// negligible impact on performance.\n",
