  "doc": "/// Set the nesting limit used for the regular expression parser.\n///\n/// The nesting limit controls how deep the abstract syntax tree is allowed\n/// to be. If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow when building a finite automaton from a regular expression's\n/// abstract syntax tree. In particular, construction currently uses\n/// recursion. In the future, the implementation may stop using recursion\n/// and this option will no longer be necessary.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire AST is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since the parser will\n/// limit itself to heap space proportional to the length of the pattern\n/// string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation AST item, which results\n/// in a nest depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that\n/// manifests in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it\n/// should not be used in a granular way.\n",
