  "doc": "/// Whether to attempt to shrink the size of the DFA's alphabet or not.\n///\n/// This option is enabled by default and should never be disabled unless\n/// one is debugging a one-pass DFA.\n///\n/// When enabled, the DFA will use a map from all possible bytes to their\n/// corresponding equivalence class. Each equivalence class represents a\n/// set of bytes that does not discriminate between a match and a non-match\n/// in the DFA. For example, the pattern `[ab]+` has at least two\n/// equivalence classes: a set containing `a` and `b` and a set containing\n/// every byte except for `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are in the same\n/// equivalence class because they never discriminate between a match and a\n/// non-match.\n///\n/// The advantage of this map is that the size of the transition table\n/// can be reduced drastically from (approximately) `#states * 256 *\n/// sizeof(StateID)` to `#states * k * sizeof(StateID)` where `k` is the\n/// number of equivalence classes (rounded up to the nearest power of 2).\n/// As a result, total space usage can decrease substantially. Moreover,\n/// since a smaller alphabet is used, DFA compilation becomes faster as\n/// well.\n///\n/// **WARNING:** This is only useful for debugging DFAs. Disabling this\n/// does not yield any speed advantages. Namely, even when this is\n/// disabled, a byte class map is still used while searching. The only\n/// difference is that every byte will be forced into its own distinct\n/// equivalence class. This is useful for debugging the actual generated\n/// transitions because it lets one see the transitions defined on actual\n/// bytes instead of the equivalence classes.\n",
