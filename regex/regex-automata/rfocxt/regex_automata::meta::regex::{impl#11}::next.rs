    /// None when no match occurs.
    pid: Option<PatternID>,
    /// The slot values, i.e., submatch offsets.
    ///
    /// In theory, the smallest sequence of slots would be something like
    /// `max(groups(pattern) for pattern in regex) * 2`, but instead, we use
    /// `sum(groups(pattern) for pattern in regex) * 2`. Why?
    ///
    /// Well, the former could be used in theory, because we don't generally
    /// have any overlapping APIs that involve capturing groups. Therefore,
    /// there's technically never any need to have slots set for multiple
    /// patterns. However, this might change some day, in which case, we would
    /// need to have slots available.
    ///
    /// The other reason is that during the execution of some regex engines,
    /// there exists a point in time where multiple slots for different
    /// patterns may be written to before knowing which pattern has matched.
    /// Therefore, the regex engines themselves, in order to support multiple
    /// patterns correctly, must have all slots available. If `Captures`
    /// doesn't have all slots available, then regex engines can't write
    /// directly into the caller provided `Captures` and must instead write
    /// into some other storage and then copy the slots involved in the match
    /// at the end of the search.
    ///
    /// So overall, at least as of the time of writing, it seems like the path
    /// of least resistance is to just require allocating all possible slots
    /// instead of the conceptual minimum. Another way to justify this is that
    /// the most common case is a single pattern, in which case, there is no
    /// inefficiency here since the 'max' and 'sum' calculations above are
    /// equivalent in that case.
    ///
    /// N.B. The mapping from group index to slot is maintained by `GroupInfo`
    /// and is considered an API guarantee. See `GroupInfo` for more details on
    /// that mapping.
    ///
    /// N.B. `Option<NonMaxUsize>` has the same size as a `usize`.
