slice: valid serialized DFA bytes produced by one of the serialization APIs, matching target platform's endianness, with length > 0 and < 2^32, containing valid state IDs and transitions, must include at least one state (state_len > 1) and at least one pattern (pattern_len > 0), ensuring `max` â‰¤ `sparse.len() - 1` and valid alignment requirements (1).
