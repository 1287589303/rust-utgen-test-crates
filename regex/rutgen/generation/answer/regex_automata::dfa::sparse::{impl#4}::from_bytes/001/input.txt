Test input conditions or ranges should include a byte slice that has the following characteristics: 0-256 bytes long (to account for potential maximal length of serialized state representation), must be produced by one of the specified serialization APIs, only valid states should be referenced (with valid state IDs ranging from 0 to state_len-1), and the endianness must match the target platform's endianness.
