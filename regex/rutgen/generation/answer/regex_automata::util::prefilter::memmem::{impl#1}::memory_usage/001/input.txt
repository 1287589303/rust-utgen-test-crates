The test input conditions or ranges for the `memory_usage` function should be based on the presence or absence of the "std" and "perf-literal-substring" features, covering scenarios where the `finder` is initialized or not. Therefore, the conditions are: 

1. Test when `feature = "std"` and `feature = "perf-literal-substring"` is enabled, with a `finder` initialized having a needle of variable lengths (0 to N bytes).
2. Test when neither feature is enabled, ensuring the code path leads to `unreachable!()`.
