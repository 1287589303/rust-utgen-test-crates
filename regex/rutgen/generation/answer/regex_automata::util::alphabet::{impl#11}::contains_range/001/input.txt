start: 0 to 255, end: 0 to 255, start <= end, ByteSet should include, exclude, or be empty for edge cases, test with minimum (0,0), single element (5,5), inclusive range with all elements (0, 255), overlapping ranges (250, 255), and empty set, ensure both values are equal (100,100) and boundary at extremes (255, 255).
