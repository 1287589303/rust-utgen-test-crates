Test input conditions or ranges include: valid regex patterns such as r"foo", r"(foo)", r"(?<a>.(?<b>.))(.)(?:.)(?<c>.)", r"[a&&b]", empty regex patterns, patterns with only the implicit group (e.g., r"(?!<noncapturing>)"), patterns with extreme nested groups, and malformed regex patterns that should error during construction; expected results are always greater than or equal to 1 for valid patterns, or an error for invalid patterns.
