Valid input patterns that are non-empty, contain at least one valid character group and adhere to regex syntax rules, include edge cases for nesting, repetition, and character classes, while ensuring balanced parentheses and defined capture groups or flags; e.g., `"(abc|def)"`, `"a{1,3}"`, `"[a-z]"`, and `"(?(?P<name>subpattern)|alternative)"`.
