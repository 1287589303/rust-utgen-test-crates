Valid input pattern must contain at least one repetition operator ('*', '+', or '?') followed by an open parenthesis '(', and must not conclude with a character class '[' or end without a closing parenthesis ')', while ensuring depth is sufficient (greater than 0) and the repetition must also not lead to an unclosed group exception.
