Test input conditions or ranges: a single-letter string representing a binary property name such as "cf", "sc", or "lc"; valid Unicode property names like "General_Category", "Script"; invalid property names; and combinations of these to test successful canonicalization as well as expected errors (e.g., "Invalid_Property_Name").
