self.kind() must be matched with instances of BuildErrorKind for each of the following cases: NFA, Unsupported(&'static str), TooManyStates, TooManyStartStates, TooManyMatchPatternIDs, DFAExceededSizeLimit { limit: usize }, DeterminizeExceededSizeLimit { limit: usize } with limit and upside specified as usize in (0, usize::MAX], and in case of 'Unsupported' a range of valid string lengths, particularly with regex feature checks in place (1 to 256 characters long).
