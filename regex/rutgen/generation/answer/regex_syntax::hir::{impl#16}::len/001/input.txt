start: char in range ['\u{0000}', '\u{FFFF}'], end: char in range ['\u{0000}', '\u{FFFF}'] such that start <= end, and test for boundary cases including identical start and end values, minimum range (start = end), maximum range (start = '\u{0000}', end = '\u{FFFF}') and invalid ranges (start = '\u{FFFF}', end = '\u{0000}') to ensure appropriate error handling.
