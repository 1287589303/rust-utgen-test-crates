input haystack is a non-empty byte slice, input span is within bounds of the haystack, input anchored is set to true, cache is initialized with a valid Cache instance, and input matches the expected pattern specified in the DFA; additionally, ensure the input length is within the operational limits of the DFA transition table (up to 256 bytes).
