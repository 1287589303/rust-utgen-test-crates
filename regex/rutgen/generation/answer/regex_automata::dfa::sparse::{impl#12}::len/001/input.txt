self.table() must be a non-empty byte slice with length divisible by StateID::SIZE (4 or 8 bytes), resulting in a return value between 1 and (self.table().len() / StateID::SIZE) where StateID::SIZE is 4 or 8 bytes, inclusive, covering scenarios where length is exactly 4 or 8 bytes and beyond, while also testing with lengths just below and above these boundaries.
