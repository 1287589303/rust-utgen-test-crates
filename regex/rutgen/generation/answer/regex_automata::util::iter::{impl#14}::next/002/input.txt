self.0 must be a valid instance of TryCapturesIter with a proper Searcher setup that has both matches leading to Capture results (where Ok(m) is returned) and cases that lead to MatchError (where Err(err) is encountered), with valid Captures having optional NonMaxUsize for slots in the range 0 to max_groups(pattern)*2 as well as ensuring that the Captures object can be constructed correctly.
