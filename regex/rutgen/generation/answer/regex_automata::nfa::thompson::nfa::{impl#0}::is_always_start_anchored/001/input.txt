Test input conditions or ranges: input patterns must include single characters, anchored patterns (e.g., "^a"), unanchored patterns (e.g., "a"), patterns with mixed anchoring (e.g., "(?m)^a", "(^a)|a"), and multiple patterns where all are anchored or include at least one unanchored pattern; test with empty strings and invalid regex patterns.
