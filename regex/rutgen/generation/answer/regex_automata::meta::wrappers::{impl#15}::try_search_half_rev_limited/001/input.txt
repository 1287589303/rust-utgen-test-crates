cache must be a mutable reference to ReverseHybridCache, input must be a valid Input instance with haystack of length > 0 and a span covering the bounds of haystack, min_start must be a non-negative integer with a value <= input.end() - 1, haystack should contain valid byte values between 0 and 255, and must also consider edge cases such as input with a single byte or min_start equal to the start of the span.
