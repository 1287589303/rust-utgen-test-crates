The input conditions should include:
1. Any `Writer<W>` instance where `W` implements the `fmt::Write` trait.
2. A test to check the state of `self.wtr` before and after calling `visit_alternation_in()`.
3. A scenario where the `write_str` method of `W` is successful, returning `Ok(())`.
4. A condition to simulate an error during the execution of `write_str`, returning `Err(fmt::Error)`.
5. Empty state of `self.wtr` to observe if '|' gets written correctly.
