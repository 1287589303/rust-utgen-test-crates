self must be a non-empty Slots instance with at least one slot available for iteration, at must be a valid usize between 0 and 31, caller_explicit_slots must be a mutable slice of length greater than the highest slot used in self, ensuring the first element corresponds to the first explicit slot in the corresponding NFA.
