dfa must be initialized correctly with valid states, input must have a haystack with length greater than 0, pattern must be valid and present in the DFA, at must start at the range [0, haystack_length - 1], and input should have span configured to encompass full haystack length; ensure at is updated to input.end() within valid bounds without triggering MatchError
