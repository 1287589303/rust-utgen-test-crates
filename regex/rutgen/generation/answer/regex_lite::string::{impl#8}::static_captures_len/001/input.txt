Pattern strings containing various capturing group configurations, including empty strings, single character patterns, multiple disjoint captured groups (e.g., "(a)|(b)"), nested group patterns (e.g., "(a(b))"), and patterns that can match empty strings (e.g., "(b)*"), tested against expected return values of Some(n) for static capture lengths and None for dynamic capture lengths.
