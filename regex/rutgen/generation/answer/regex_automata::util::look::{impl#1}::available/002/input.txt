self.bits should be set with values representing various Unicode word boundary assertions while ensuring that the `unicode-word-boundary` feature is enabled; valid values for bits include `0b00000000000000000000000000000001` to `0b00000000000000000000011111111111` (representing different combinations of assertions)
