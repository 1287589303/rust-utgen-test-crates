Input must include a valid single pattern with length 1 for `self.get_nfa().pattern_len()` and a haystack string that leads to successful `search_slots` execution yielding valid start slots and an invalid end slot; e.g., input "a", with cache state reflecting prior successful searches with matched patterns and spans.
