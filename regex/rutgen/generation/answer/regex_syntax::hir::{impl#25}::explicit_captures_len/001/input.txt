Test input conditions or ranges: Valid regex strings with varying explicit capturing groups, including no groups (e.g., "a", "b") returning 0; a single group (e.g., "(a)", "(b)") returning 1; multiple groups (e.g., "(a)(b)", "(c|d)") returning counts greater than 1; and edge cases with empty strings, malformed regex, or nested groups returning counts up to the expected maximum based on regex complexity.
