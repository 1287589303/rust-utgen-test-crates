input should have non-empty haystack with at least one byte, cache must be mutable and initialized, sid must be a valid LazyStateID produced by start_state_forward, and start of input must be less than end length; specifically, 0 <= input.start() < input.end() <= haystack.len(), where haystack is a non-empty &[u8] with at least one element.
