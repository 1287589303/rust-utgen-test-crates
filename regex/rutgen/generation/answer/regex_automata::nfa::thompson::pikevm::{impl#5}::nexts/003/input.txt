Valid values for `stack` (non-empty Vec<FollowEpsilon>), `curr` (active states with non-empty SparseSet), `next` (mutable ActiveStates), `input` (Input with haystack of arbitrary byte length), `at` (valid index within byte array), and `slots` (mutable array with at least length equal to slots_for_captures of slot_table in curr) with conditions that allow multiple invocations of self.next returning None.
