Valid NFA instances constructed with various complexity (e.g. simple, complex, with multiple patterns), NFA having less than the pattern ID limit (200), varying configuration options like byte_classes enabled/disabled, different MatchKind settings, NFA with explicit slots less than 16, and empty state handling (e.g. no states).
