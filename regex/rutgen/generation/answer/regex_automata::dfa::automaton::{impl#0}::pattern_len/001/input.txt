test input conditions: test with valid automaton instances, including simple patterns (e.g., "a", "abc"), complex patterns (e.g., ".*", "[a-z]+"), and edge cases like empty patterns, ensuring that `pattern_len()` returns a non-negative usize value within expected ranges (0 for empty, >0 for non-empty) with varied Unicode character possibilities.
