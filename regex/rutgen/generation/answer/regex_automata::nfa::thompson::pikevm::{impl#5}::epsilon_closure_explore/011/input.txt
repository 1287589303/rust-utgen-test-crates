next.set.insert(sid) is true; sid corresponds to a Sparse or Dense state in the NFA; curr_slots is a mutable array of valid Option<NonMaxUsize> with length at least as much as the maximum slot index from the NFA; input is a valid Input<'_> with haystack length > 0; at is a valid index within the haystack bounds; slot.as_usize() < curr_slots.len() for Capture states where applicable.
