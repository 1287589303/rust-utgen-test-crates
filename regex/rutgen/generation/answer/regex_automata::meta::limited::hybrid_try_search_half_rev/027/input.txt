dfa should be a valid DFA instance, cache should be a mutable Cache instance, input should have non-empty haystack of length greater than 1, input.start() is less than input.end(), min_start should be less than input.end() and at should be greater than min_start, haystack[at] should be a valid byte in the input haystack which leads to a valid next state
