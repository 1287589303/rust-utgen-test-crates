Test input conditions or ranges: multiple regex patterns including at least one lowercase letter, one digit, and one word character; ensure patterns are functional (e.g., `r"[a-z]+"`, `r"[0-9]+"`, `r"\w+"`) and check edge cases like an empty pattern set or patterns with maximal length for the regex engine.
