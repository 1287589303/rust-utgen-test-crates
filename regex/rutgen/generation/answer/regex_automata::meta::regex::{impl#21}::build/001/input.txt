Valid pattern strings including empty string, invalid regex patterns (e.g., unclosed parentheses), valid regex patterns (e.g., "foo", ".*", "^abc$"), edge cases (e.g., patterns with special characters, patterns exceeding typical length limits), and ensure both utf8 and non-utf8 encoding scenarios are covered.
