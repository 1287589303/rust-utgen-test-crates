Valid regex patterns of varying complexities, including an empty regex, a simple regex (e.g., "abc"), special characters (e.g., ".*"), anchored patterns (e.g., "^abc"), and pattern containing capture groups (e.g., "(foo)(bar)"), with and without escape sequences, to ensure coverage of valid string inputs and boundary cases.
