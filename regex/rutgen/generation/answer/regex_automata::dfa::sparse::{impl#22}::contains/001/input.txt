self.set must be initialized (non-empty BTreeSet in "alloc" feature) with valid StateID instances; id must be a valid StateID instance representing a state; test cases should include scenarios where id exists in set (true return value) and where it does not exist (false return value); edge case of checking with a null or default StateID instance should also be included.
