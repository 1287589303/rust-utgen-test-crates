slice must be at least 256 bytes long, contain a valid state length (between 1 and MAX_U32 / 512), a valid stride2 (between 1 and 9), a valid ByteClasses representation with alphabet_len() less than or equal to the stride, and cause wire::mul to return an error with the total byte length of the transition table exceeding 8 bytes or being aligned improperly with StateID.
