start char should be between U+0000 and U+D7FF and end char should be between U+0000 and U+D7FF, ensuring r.split() can return valid r1 and r2; valid scalar ranges such that r.start < r.end; r.start < 0xD800; r.end >= 0xE000; and ascii range valid for r.as_ascii(), with cases where r.start produces an encoded length of 1 to 4 for utf-8, resulting in Some(Utf8Sequence::from_encoded_range(&[0..n], &[0..n])) where n is the encoded length.
