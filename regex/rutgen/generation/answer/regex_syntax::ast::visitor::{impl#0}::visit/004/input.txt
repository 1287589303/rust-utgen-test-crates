visitor must be a type that implements Visitor with expected Result<V::Output, V::Err>; ast must be a reference to a valid Ast enum variant (not Empty), excluding ones that would cause visitor.visit_post() to fail at line 224; the ast must represent an inductive structure ideally with Repetition, Group, Concat, and Alternation to fulfill all preconditions and ensure stack operations successfully pop elements; stack should initially be empty, and visitor should be in a state ready to process (calling start() successfully at line 213) before invoking visit() with predetermined ast variants.
