Valid test conditions for `no_expansion()` method execution: `self` must be a mutable reference to an object implementing `Replacer` trait, where it can return `Some(Cow<'_, str>)` or `None`, covering both implementations of trait methods, including edge cases like no available expansion or correctly returning Cow references.
