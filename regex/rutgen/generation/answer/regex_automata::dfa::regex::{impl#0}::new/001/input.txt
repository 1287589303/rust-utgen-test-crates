Valid test inputs for the `Regex::new` function range from empty strings to patterns with various complexities, including but not limited to: valid regex patterns (e.g., "abc", "foo[0-9]+bar", "(a|b)*", ".*"), invalid regex patterns (e.g., "foo[", "(", "?), "only special characters" (e.g., "?!@#$%^&*()"), and patterns with varying lengths (1 to 1000 characters).
