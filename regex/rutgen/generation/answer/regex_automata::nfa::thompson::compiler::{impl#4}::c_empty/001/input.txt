self.add_empty() inputs must be diverse, including valid inputs that successfully return a StateID and erroneous inputs that cause add_empty() to return a BuildError. Test ranges should include scenarios where size_limit is None or set to various sizes including edge cases (0, minimal, and maximal sizes). Additionally, states must cover both UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 transformations and account for configurations where utf8 or reverse flags are enabled/disabled.
