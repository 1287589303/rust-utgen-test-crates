Test input conditions or ranges: test with a variety of Unicode characters including alphabetic characters (e.g., 'a', 'Z', 'あ'), join control characters (e.g., '\u200C', '\u200D'), decimal numbers (e.g., '1', '2', '٣'), marks (e.g., '\u0300'), and connector punctuation (e.g., '_', '•'); also test with non-word characters such as punctuation (e.g., '!', '?', '@'), whitespace (e.g., ' ', '\t'), or control characters (e.g., '\n') for boundary cases.
