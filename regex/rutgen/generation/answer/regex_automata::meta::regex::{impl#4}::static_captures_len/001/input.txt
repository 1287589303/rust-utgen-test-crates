valid regex patterns including simple (e.g., "a", "(a)"), alternation (e.g., "(a)|(b)"), grouping (e.g., "(a)(b)|(c)(d)"), patterns with optional groups (e.g., "(b)*"), patterns with quantifiers (e.g., "(b)+"); edge cases including empty patterns, invalid regex patterns, single character patterns, patterns with only alternation; patterns resulting in None (e.g., "(a)|b", "a|(b)"); multiple patterns with consistent static captures (e.g., &["(a)", "(b)"], &["(a)|(b)", "(c)|(d)"]); and patterns with differing numbers of captures in multiple patterns resulting in None.
