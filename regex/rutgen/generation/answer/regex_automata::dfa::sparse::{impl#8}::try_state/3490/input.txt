id.as_usize() == self.sparse().len(), ntrans == 257, ntrans == 0, is_match == false, sp.is_match_state(id) == false, state contains valid slices of bytes for input_ranges and next, input_ranges with even number of elements where each pair satisfies start <= end, next contains valid state IDs, and pattern IDs length reads as 0.
