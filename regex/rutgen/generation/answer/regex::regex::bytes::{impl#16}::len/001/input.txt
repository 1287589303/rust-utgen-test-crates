Regex patterns that include various combinations of capturing groups (e.g., at least 1 group, multiple groups, empty pattern), matched and unmatched cases, and inputs consisting of empty strings and strings that can't match the regex, covering scenarios like a valid regex, completely unmatched regex, and edge cases near the limits of allowable inputs (e.g., very large regex patterns).
