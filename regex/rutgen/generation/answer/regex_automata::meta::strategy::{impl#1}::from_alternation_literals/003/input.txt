info must be a valid &RegexInfo instance and hirs must be a slice with exactly one element that is a valid &Hir which is an alternation of literals, where the literals in hirs resulting in at least 3000 literals from alternation_literals function, ensuring valid properties in info such that look_set() is empty, explicit_captures_len() is 0, and is_alternation_literal() returns true with MatchKind::LeftmostFirst for the success of AhoCorasick::new function.
