Test input conditions or ranges: test with an empty sequence (Seq::empty()), a sequence containing some exact literals (e.g., Literal with exact = true), a sequence containing some inexact literals (e.g., Literal with exact = false), a sequence with all inexact literals (all exact = false), a sequence representing all possible literals (None), a sequence that is infinite (Seq::infinite()).
