1. ByteClasses input with varying filled byte classes arrays of length 256, including all zeroes, all ones, and combinations of filled and empty byte classes.
2. Valid LazyStateID results when input ByteClasses allows for minimal state representation (i.e., starting conditions with the minimum number of states).
3. Ensure input conditions that explore boundary cases around MAX value for LazyStateID (e.g., input that results in state ID just below MAX, at MAX, and just above MAX).
4. Edge cases for 16-bit systems where MIN_STATES is higher than capacity (e.g., MIN_STATES = 4, and verify with a 16-bit calculation).
5. Test cases where stride results in zero or minimal power of two conditions (e.g., ByteClasses with no filled entries).
