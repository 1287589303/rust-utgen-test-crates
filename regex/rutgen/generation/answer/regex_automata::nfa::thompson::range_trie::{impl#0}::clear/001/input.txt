mut self must be a valid mutable reference to an instance of RangeTrie with at least one State currently in states, ensuring states is not empty; the states vector can contain a mix of various State types but must not exceed its allocated size to prevent panics in add_empty; check behavior when called on an already cleared RangeTrie.
