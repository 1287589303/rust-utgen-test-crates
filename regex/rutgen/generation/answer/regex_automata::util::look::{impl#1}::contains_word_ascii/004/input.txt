self.bits must contain the bit representation for Look::WordEndAscii (i.e., 1 << 11), and not contain bits for Look::WordAscii (1 << 6), Look::WordAsciiNegate (1 << 7), Look::WordStartAscii (1 << 10), Look::WordStartHalfAscii (1 << 14), and Look::WordEndHalfAscii (1 << 15) which means self.bits can be 0b0000_0000_0000_1000 (0b0000_0000_0000_0111 is not acceptable) or any combination that includes the Look::WordEndAscii bit while excluding the others, producing valid inputs within the range of 0 to 65535 for u16.
