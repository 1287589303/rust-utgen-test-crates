self.ranges contains at least one interval, other.ranges contains at least one interval, self.ranges[a] and other.ranges[b] intersect (i.e., they share a common range), self.ranges[a].upper() == other.ranges[b].upper(), the iteration across self.ranges does not continue (it.next() returns None), self.folded is false.
