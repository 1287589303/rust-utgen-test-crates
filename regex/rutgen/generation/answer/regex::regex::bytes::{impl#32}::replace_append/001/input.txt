Self must implement FnMut with a return type that implements AsRef<[u8]>; caps must be a valid reference to a Captures instance containing non-empty haystack; dst must be a mutable reference to an empty Vec<u8> or an existing Vec<u8> capable of accumulating bytes; test at least one case with an empty captures structure, a captures structure with one match, and maximum plausible captures based on system's memory constraints.
