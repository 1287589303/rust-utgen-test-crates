slice input must be a byte array of at least 9 bytes (1 + 4 + 4) with appropriate alignment for u32, containing a valid u32 length followed by well-formed accelerators; valid lengths of accelerators can be from 0 to 2^31-1, and the length of the slice must exactly support these accelerators with 4 bytes for the length and align properly to u32.
