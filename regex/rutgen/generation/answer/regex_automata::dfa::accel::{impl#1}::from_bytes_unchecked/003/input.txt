slice length must be greater than or equal to 4 (for the length of the accelerator), and slice content must have a valid u32 at the beginning, followed by enough bytes to form a valid number of accelerators (up to 2 * u32 + 1 for total length), total length must be â‰¤ (8 * acceleration length + 4) bytes while ensuring alignment to 4 bytes; additionally, add operation must trigger an arithmetic overflow error when accelerator length exceeds u32 limits.
