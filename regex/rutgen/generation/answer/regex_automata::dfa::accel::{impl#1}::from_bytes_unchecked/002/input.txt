Test input conditions: slice must be a byte array of length >= 4 (to read accelerator length) and containing values such that `wire::try_read_u32_as_usize` returns Ok, while also being constructed such that `accel_len` leads to arithmetic overflow when multiplied by 2 (i.e. `accel_len` > usize::MAX / 2).
