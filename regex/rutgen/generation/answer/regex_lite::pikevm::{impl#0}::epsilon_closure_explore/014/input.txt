next.set.insert(sid) should be tested with an existing StateID that was already inserted, and haystack can have varying lengths (1-1000 bytes) with at types (0-1000), ensuring sid is a valid StateID within bounds (0-255) and curr_slots should range from empty to full capacities (0-10 slots), check transitions for all NFA state types that can be reached under these conditions.
