self.stacks must contain at least one stack which is available for locking, caller must be within the range of 0 to an upper limit that allows calculation of stack_id, and the value must be a valid Box<T> type that can be pushed onto the stack; the loop must be tested with attempts from 0 to 10 for boundary conditions on locking behavior.
