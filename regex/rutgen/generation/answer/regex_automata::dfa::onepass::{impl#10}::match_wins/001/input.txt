self.0 values should include at least 0 and values around 2^21-1, with specific attention to values that result in the highest bit of "match wins" being both 0 and 1, thus: 0, (1 << Transition::MATCH_WINS_SHIFT), (1 << Transition::MATCH_WINS_SHIFT) - 1, (1 << Transition::MATCH_WINS_SHIFT) + 1, and (1 << Transition::MATCH_WINS_SHIFT) + (1 << (Transition::MATCH_WINS_SHIFT - 1)).
