`self.slots` should be tested with ranges where:
- Length of `slots`: 0 to N, where N is a reasonable limit based on expected maximum number of capturing groups (e.g., 0 to 100).
- Each element in `slots` can be `None` or `Some(NonMaxUsize)`; therefore, at least test the following scenarios:
  - All elements are `None`.
  - Some elements are `None` and others are `Some(NonMaxUsize)`.
  - All elements are `Some(NonMaxUsize)` with valid indices in the range of 1 to the maximum possible value of `usize`.
- Check edge cases where the `slots` array size is near system memory limits, e.g., `alloc::MAX` sizes if applicable.
