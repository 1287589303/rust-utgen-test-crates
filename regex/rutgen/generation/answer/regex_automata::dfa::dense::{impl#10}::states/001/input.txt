Valid input should include a non-empty DFA instance with a defined transition table (tt) where the number of states is greater than zero, the stride is within the range of 1 to 9, and the transition table is appropriately sized to contain 256 transitions for each state with valid state identifiers between 0 and total number of states - 1.
