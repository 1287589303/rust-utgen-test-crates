slice: &[u8] with length >= 8 bytes, where the first 4 bytes represent a valid u32 (for state_len), and the total length for subsequent reads must sufficiently accommodate patterns of at least one 32-bit value, specifically checking boundaries where state_len is 1 and also large values to test multiplication overflow cases.
