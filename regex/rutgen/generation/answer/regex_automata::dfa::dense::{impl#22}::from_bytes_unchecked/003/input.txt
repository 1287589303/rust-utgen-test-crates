slice must be a non-empty byte array with a length of at least 4 bytes for state_len, must allow alignment for PatternID, and must ensure a calculated bytes length exceeding available slice length for sequences based on state_len bounded by limits of usize to trigger an arithmetic overflow in wire::mul; specifically, with state_len values from 0 to near the max of usize/2.
