Valid test input conditions or ranges: capacity: 0 to MAX_CAPACITY inclusive, where MAX_CAPACITY is the maximum supported StateID value; ensure sparse length and dense length are both within 0 to MAX_CAPACITY; ensure both dense and sparse vectors contain StateID values as they would be added/inserted in various scenarios.
