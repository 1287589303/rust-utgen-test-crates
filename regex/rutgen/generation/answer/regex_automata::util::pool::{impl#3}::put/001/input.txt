'PoolGuard' should have a valid reference to a 'Pool<T, F>' instance, 'T' must implement 'Send', and 'F' must be a function type that returns 'T'; testing should include boundary cases for empty and full pools, different types 'T' like integer, string, and user-defined structs, and variations of function 'F' that return default, complex or erroneous values.
