Test input conditions or ranges: pattern string with varying complexity (empty string, string without captures, string with explicit capture groups, and strings with nested captures), ensure consistency in capture group counts across matches, test with both start-anchored and non start-anchored patterns, include scenarios with zero capture groups and large number of capture groups (maximum size of usize)
