Test input conditions: `dst` must have a length less than `nwrite`, which is determined by `self.write_to_len()`; thus, test with `dst` of lengths in the range of `0` to `nwrite - 1` where `nwrite` varies based on `self` attributes like `kind`, `start_map`, `stride`, `pattern_len`, `universal_start_unanchored`, `universal_start_anchored`, and number of entries in `self.table()`.
