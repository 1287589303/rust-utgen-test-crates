The input conditions or ranges to test the `iter_nfa_state_ids` function should include: valid `State` object with non-empty internal representation, a variety of `StateID` values to cover all possible IDs including minimum (0) and maximum (defined by system), and edge cases such as empty states or states that do not produce any `StateID`.
