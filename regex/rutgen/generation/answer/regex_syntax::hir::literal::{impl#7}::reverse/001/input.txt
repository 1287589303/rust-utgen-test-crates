self.bytes must be a non-empty Vec<u8> and must have a length greater than or equal to 1. The function should handle a Literal instance with varying sizes of the bytes field, including 1 byte, 2 bytes, and higher lengths up to a reasonable large size (e.g., 1000 bytes) to cover edge cases. Additionally, test inputs should include edge conditions for memory use, such as the maximum capacity for Vec<u8>.
