Valid input ranges for `Utf8Sequence` instances include:
- For `One`: `start` and `end` where start and end are equal (both 0 to 255).
- For `Two`: `start` and `end` arrays of size 2, with each element in the range 0 to 255.
- For `Three`: `start` and `end` arrays of size 3, with each element in the range 0 to 255.
- For `Four`: `start` and `end` arrays of size 4, with each element in the range 0 to 255.
- Test null or empty slice scenarios and ensure they do not crash the function.
