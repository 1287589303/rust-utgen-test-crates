self must be a mutable reference to a valid LookSet instance, other must be a valid LookSet instance; test input ranges: self.bits in {0, 1, 2, ..., 0xFFFFFFFF}, other.bits in {0, 1, 2, ..., 0xFFFFFFFF}; test for cases where both are empty, one is full, one is empty, or both are partially filled, including validating edge cases like full union result and unchanged input.
