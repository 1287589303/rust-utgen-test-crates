Test input conditions or ranges: regex patterns as a list of strings including at least one pattern with special characters, one pattern for digits, one pattern for lowercase letters, one pattern for uppercase letters, and input strings that include combinations of these characters for various test cases, including edge cases like empty strings and strings with only special characters, ensuring at least one match and none; also, ensure the regex set is built with 1 to 10 patterns for coverage of varying sizes.
