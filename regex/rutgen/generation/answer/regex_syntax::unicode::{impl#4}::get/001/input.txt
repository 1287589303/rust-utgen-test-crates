Test input conditions or ranges: Input a valid Unicode scalar character (e.g., from U+0000 to U+10FFFF) to return a valid index or a valid error code when the character is not present; include boundary characters (U+0000, U+007F, U+00FF, U+FFFF, U+10FFFF) and characters just outside the table range to test edge scenarios.
