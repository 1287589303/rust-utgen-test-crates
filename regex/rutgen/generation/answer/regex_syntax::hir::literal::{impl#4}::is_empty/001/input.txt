is_empty() method should be tested with Seq instances initialized as follows: 1) Seq with literals as None (represents all possible literals), 2) Seq with an empty Vec as literals (represents an empty sequence), 3) Seq with a non-empty Vec containing one or more Literal instances including empty strings, 4) Seq created using Singleton with a non-empty Literal, 5) Seq created using new() with various iterable inputs including empty, single, and multiple elements.
