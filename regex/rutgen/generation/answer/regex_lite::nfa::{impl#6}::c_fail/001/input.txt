self.add(State::Fail) must return an Err value indicating exhaustion of state IDs, and ensure that the NFA's states vector has reached the maximum limit acceptable by the function (typically at capacity or leading to Error::new("exhausted state IDs, too many states")) in a context where memory_extra and states both have non-zero values.
