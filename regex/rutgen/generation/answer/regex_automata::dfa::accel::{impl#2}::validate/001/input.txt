self.as_bytes() contains a byte slice of length between ACCEL_TY_SIZE and ACCEL_TY_SIZE + N * ACCEL_CAP where N is a non-negative integer and each chunk has exactly ACCEL_CAP bytes, with at least one chunk causing Accel::from_slice(chunk) to return Err/None due to invalid data or insufficient length.
