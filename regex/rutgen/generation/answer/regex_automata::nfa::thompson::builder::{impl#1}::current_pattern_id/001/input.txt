Valid test inputs include the scenario where `start_pattern` has been called but `finish_pattern` has not, and the expected return is a valid `PatternID`. Test inputs should also include the scenario where `current_pattern_id` is called without prior invocation of `start_pattern`, which is expected to panic.
