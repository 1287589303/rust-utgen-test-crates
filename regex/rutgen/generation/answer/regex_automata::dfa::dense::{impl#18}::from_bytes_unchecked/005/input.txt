Test input conditions or ranges: slice length at least 8 bytes, first 4 bytes representing a valid StartKind (0, 1, or 2), next 256 bytes representing valid StartByteMap entries (values in range 0-5), followed by 4 bytes for stride equal to 6, valid length of remaining bytes for patterns consistent with possible state transitions, pattern length can be 0 or None; leading to successful deserialization of start state IDs.
