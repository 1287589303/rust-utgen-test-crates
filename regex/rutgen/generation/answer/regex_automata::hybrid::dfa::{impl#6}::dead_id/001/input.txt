LazyStateID should be generated using inputs where 1 << stride2 results in values up to and including the maximum allowed state ID for the target architecture (32, 64, or 16 bits) and should ensure it correctly handles the conversion to dead state ID for various configurations of stride2; valid inputs are stride2 values between 0 to 8 for 32-bit systems, 0 to 8 for 64-bit systems, and 0 to 15 for 16-bit systems.
