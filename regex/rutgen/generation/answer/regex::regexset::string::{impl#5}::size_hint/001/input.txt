self.it must be a valid core::ops::Range<usize>, with the range starting at a non-negative integer and ending at a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to the start; specifically, test inputs should cover cases where self.it is an empty range, a range with one element, a range with multiple elements, and also the maximum valid range of usize.
