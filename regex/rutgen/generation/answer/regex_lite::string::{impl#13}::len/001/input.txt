valid regex patterns with varying numbers of capture groups (e.g., r"(\\w)(\\d)?(\\w)", r"(\w+)(\d*)", r"(a)(b)(c)", r"(x)(y)", r"()"), input strings matching the patterns with different configurations (e.g., "XYZ123", "A", "12", ""), and ensure at least one match present for each test to return a length greater than zero, including boundary cases with no groups
