i >= 0 and i < number of capture groups in the regex, where number of capture groups includes at least one group for i == 0, and test cases should include valid and invalid indices, ensuring edge cases such as i = 0, i = 1 (valid), and i = N (where N is the total number of capture groups) and i = N+1 (invalid) are covered.
