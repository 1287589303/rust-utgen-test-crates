Self must cover byte ranges that overlap with both b'a' to b'z' and b'A' to b'Z'; thus, test inputs should range from (lower bound of 97 to upper bound of 122 for lowercase) and (lower bound of 65 to upper bound of 90 for uppercase), allowing for overlapping in spans, such as start=65 and end=122, and inclusive boundaries.
