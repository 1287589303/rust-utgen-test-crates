Input conditions: Provide a `PatternSet` initialized with a variety of patterns, including edge cases with zero patterns, one pattern, and multiple patterns, and test against byte strings that vary in complexity (including those that match all, match none, and partially match). Ensure to include boundary cases like empty byte strings and maximum length byte strings.
