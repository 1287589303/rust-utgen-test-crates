Valid input ranges for `range` as `Utf8Range` where `start` and `end` are `u8` values, including edge cases: `start = 0, end = 0`, `start = 0, end = 255`, `start = 255, end = 255`, `start = 1, end = 2`, overlaps with existing transitions, `start > end` to test invalid inputs, and an empty `transitions` vector scenario.
