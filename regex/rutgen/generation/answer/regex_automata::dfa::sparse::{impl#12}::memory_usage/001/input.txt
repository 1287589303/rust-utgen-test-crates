self.table must be a non-empty slice of bytes (length > 0) to avoid boundary case issues and should operate within a typical range of sizes, ensuring len is computed correctly from one byte (1) to the maximum expected length for performance (e.g., 256 bytes) depending on patterns and DFA configuration.
