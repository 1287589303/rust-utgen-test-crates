ranges = [Utf8Range { start: 0, end: 1 }, Utf8Range { start: 2, end: 3 }, Utf8Range { start: 4, end: 5 }, Utf8Range { start: 6, end: 7 }] with valid adjacent and non-overlapping ranges to ensure non-empty input, total length of 4, and simulate the case where splits involve old ranges with potential overlaps
