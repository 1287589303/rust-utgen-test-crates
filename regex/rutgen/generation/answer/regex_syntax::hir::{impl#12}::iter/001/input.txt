Test with a ClassUnicode instance initialized with an empty set, a set containing a single range (e.g., ClassUnicodeRange with start='a' and end='c'), and a set with multiple non-overlapping ranges (e.g., ClassUnicodeRange with start='a' and end='b', and another with start='d' and end='e'); ensure iteration returns ranges in ascending order.
