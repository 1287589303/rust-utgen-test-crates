pattern_groups must be an iterable collection of collections of Option<&str> with at least one pattern containing both Some and None elements; expected return values include sizes such as 0 for empty GroupInfo, values strictly greater than 0 for non-empty GroupInfo, and must cover cases with varying numbers of capturing groups such as 0, 1, or multiple patterns.
