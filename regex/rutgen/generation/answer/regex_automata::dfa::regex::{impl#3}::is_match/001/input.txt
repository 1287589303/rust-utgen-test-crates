Input must be a string or byte array that may potentially match a regex pattern, must not lead to panics due to unsupported configurations, and should cover cases with valid patterns, empty inputs, inputs that do not match the regex, and tests near boundaries of the expected matching behavior (e.g., input lengths right at or just above pattern lengths).
