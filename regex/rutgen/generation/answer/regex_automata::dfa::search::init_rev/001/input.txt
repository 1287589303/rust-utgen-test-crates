Input with a valid input structure containing haystack of varying lengths (0 to N bytes), all possible spans (including edge cases where span starts or ends at the boundaries of the haystack), different anchored states (both true and false), and a state of earliest set to both true and false; additionally, test cases where dfa.start_state_reverse returns an error type, triggering the Result::Err return path.
