slice: any byte array of length 4 to 8 bytes (to test valid and invalid lengths); what: any valid static string (noun in singular form); test with u32 values that are within usize range (0 to max usize) and u32 values that exceed usize range (max usize + 1); also include edge cases like an empty slice or a slice with fewer than 4 bytes.
