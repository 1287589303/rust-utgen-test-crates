Test input conditions/ranges: Ensure `states` is empty when calling `create_state` (i.e., initial call), `states` has up to 10 elements to test sequential ID allocation, `states` exceeds 10 elements (e.g., 11) to validate consistent ID allocation, and call `create_state` with varied states present to check ID uniqueness across multiple calls.
