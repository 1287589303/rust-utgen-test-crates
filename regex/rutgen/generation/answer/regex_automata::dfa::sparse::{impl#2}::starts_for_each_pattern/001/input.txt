The test input conditions or ranges are: DFA instances with pattern lengths as None (empty DFA), Some(0) (DFA without patterns), Some(n) where n > 0 (DFA with patterns) and ensure that the `starts_for_each_pattern` method is called on each state of the DFA to confirm the correctness of the output based on the pattern length condition.
