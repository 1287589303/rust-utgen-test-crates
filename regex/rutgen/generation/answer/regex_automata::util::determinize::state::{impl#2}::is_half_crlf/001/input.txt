Test input conditions or ranges: Test inputs should include states represented by `Arc<[u8]>` where the first byte has the 3rd bit set (value 8) to return true for is_half_crlf, and states with varying first byte values (0-255) to cover the complete byte range including boundary checks for both true and false conditions.
