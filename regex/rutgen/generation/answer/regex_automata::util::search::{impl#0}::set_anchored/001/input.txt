Testing for the `set_anchored` function should include conditions for the `Anchored` enum variants, covering valid and edge cases for each variant, and ensuring the input struct is properly initialized. The test input conditions or ranges are:

valid haystack with length > 0 and for Anchored variant: No, Yes, or Pattern(PatternID) where PatternID is valid.
