Self-reference types: OnePassEngine involves references to internal structures and checks feature flags. Inputs for testing should include conditions where the "dfa-onepass" feature is enabled and disabled, alongside valid and invalid NFA instances. Test inputs should cover cases where the instance is constructed correctly and where the unreachable code path is triggered.

Input conditions or ranges: "dfa-onepass" feature enabled (valid NFA), "dfa-onepass" feature disabled (invoke unreachable), valid NFA instance with non-zero memory usage, empty NFA instance (zero memory usage).
