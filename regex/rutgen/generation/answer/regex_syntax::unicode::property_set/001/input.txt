name_map must be a non-empty static slice of tuples where each tuple contains a static string and a static range, canonical must be a non-empty static string that exactly matches one of the static strings in name_map, and the expected return value is an Option<Range> that holds a valid range corresponding to the canonical input in the name_map.
