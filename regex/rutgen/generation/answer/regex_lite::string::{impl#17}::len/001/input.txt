Validations of regex patterns and scenarios yielding capture group lengths of at least 1 through various regex patterns, including valid multi-capturing groups such as r"(?<first>\w+)\s+(?<last>\w+)" yielding lengths of 3, empty patterns yielding lengths of 1, and non-matching patterns yielding lengths of 1, covering edge cases for regex complexity and regex non-matching conditions.
