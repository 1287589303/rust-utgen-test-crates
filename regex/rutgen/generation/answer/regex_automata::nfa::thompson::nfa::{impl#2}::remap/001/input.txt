self.states must contain at least one State with valid transitions; old_to_new must be a mapped array with lengths equal to self.states; self.start_pattern must contain valid StateID indices referencing self.states; old_to_new must handle edge cases where StateID is not found leading to potential out-of-bounds errors; ensure old_to_new is an empty slice to test behavior with no state mappings
