Input strings containing varying combinations of characters, including:
1. Strings without a dollar sign (`$`) of varying lengths (e.g., "", "a", "abc", "123", "special char !@#%").
2. Strings with a single dollar sign (`$`): `"$"`, `"abc$"`, `"$abc"`, `"abc$def"`.
3. Strings with multiple dollar signs (e.g., `"$$"`, `"abc$$"`, `"$abc$def$"`).
4. Edge cases: very short strings (including empty string), very long strings (up to limits of string handling in Rust).
5. Strings with non-standard characters or unicode (e.g., `"こんにちは"`, `"abc$def$ghi"`).
