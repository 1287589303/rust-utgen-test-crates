The input conditions or ranges should include one or more valid regex patterns as strings, ensuring at least one pattern for non-empty input, and must accommodate special characters as well as mixed regex classes (like alphanumeric), while also checking the edge cases of an empty pattern array or patterns that may not compile into valid regex, which should trigger a `BuildError`. Thus, the inputs can range from `[]` (empty) to combinations of valid regex strings such as `[r"[a-z]+", r"[0-9]+"]`, `[r"\d{2,4}", r"[A-Z]+"]`, or other valid and invalid regex patterns, including special characters that require escaping.
