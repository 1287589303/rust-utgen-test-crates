n = 0 or n = 1 (for lines 1234 and 1278), expr can match empty string (for line 1239), expr has minimum length for the case n = 0 (for line 1239), self.c_exactly(expr, n - 1)? (for line 1289) is Ok, self.c(expr)? (for line 1290) is Ok, greedy is false (for line 1291), and self.add_union_reverse() returns Err/None (for line 1291).
