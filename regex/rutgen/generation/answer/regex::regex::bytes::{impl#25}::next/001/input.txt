The test input conditions or ranges should consider the following: a set of valid regex patterns including empty patterns, variations of capture groups, both valid and invalid inputs (e.g., no matches), and cases where the capture groups contain different types of strings (including special characters, Unicode, etc.) while ensuring varying lengths (including edge cases like a single character or very large strings).
