Valid regex patterns including at least one capturing group, with patterns covering no groups, one group, multiple groups, named groups, nested groups, and ensuring no empty patterns (e.g., r"foo", r"(foo)", r"(?<a>.(?<b>.))(.)(?:.)(?<c>.)", r"[^\s\S]"), while also accounting for edge cases like large patterns or patterns that only match the entire string; tests should ensure output returns are >= 1.
