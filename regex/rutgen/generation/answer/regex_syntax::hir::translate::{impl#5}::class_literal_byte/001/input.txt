valid input where `ast` is an `ast::Literal` that has a valid byte representation, including edge cases of minimum and maximum ASCII characters, scenarios where `ast` represents a non-ASCII character, and situations where `ast` might not have a valid byte (e.g., a null pointer or an invalid reference).
