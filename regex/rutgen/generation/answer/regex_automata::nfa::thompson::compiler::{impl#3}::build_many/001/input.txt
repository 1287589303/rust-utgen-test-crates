The inferred test input conditions or ranges are: empty patterns array `[]`, patterns with invalid regex strings such as `["*invalid>", "(", ")"])`, patterns with correct syntax but special characters like `[".*-", "\\w+"]`, max length of patterns at a reasonable limit (e.g., 100 characters) containing typical regex constructs (like `[a-z]`, `\(a\|b\)`), and scenarios where the regex syntax itself is valid but semantically incorrect, to ensure the syntax error handling triggers (like `["[a-z]??"]`).
