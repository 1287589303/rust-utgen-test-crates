Input patterns must be an array of string slices with a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of a reasonable upper limit (e.g., 10), each string must conform to valid regex syntax (e.g., contain characters like [a-z]+ or [0-9]+), and the resulting Regex should not return a BuildError on successful creation.
