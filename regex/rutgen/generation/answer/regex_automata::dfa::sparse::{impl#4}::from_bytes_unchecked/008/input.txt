The input slice should be a valid byte array that adheres to the following conditions: contains a valid label matching LABEL, a proper endianness indicator, a correct version number matching VERSION, includes a 4-byte unused space, encompasses a valid Flags representation, follows with valid Transitions data, includes valid StartTable data, and finally has a Special struct resulting in an error when deserializing (e.g., special.max greater than the length of transitions or invalid serialized data), which triggers the `DeserializeError`.
