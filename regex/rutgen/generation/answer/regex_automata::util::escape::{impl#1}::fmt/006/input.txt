Input conditions: 
- A non-empty byte slice containing valid UTF-8 sequences, including at least one byte that is not a valid UTF-8 start byte (e.g., 0x80) to trigger the Err(byte) case, and also including control characters like '\0', '\x01', '\x7f' to test various branches; range examples: [0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x7f, 0x80, 0xC3, 0xA9] or a series of valid and invalid mixed bytes to assess all cases.
