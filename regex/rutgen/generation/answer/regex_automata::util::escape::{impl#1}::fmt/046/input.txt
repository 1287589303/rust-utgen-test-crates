Test input conditions or ranges: non-empty byte slices containing valid UTF-8 sequences, including edge cases with control characters, null bytes, and sequences that trigger both the Ok and Err paths in decode function, such as: [0x00], [0x01, 0x02], [0x7f], [0x80], [0xff], and [0x61, 0x62, 0x63] for valid UTF-8, ensuring coverage of both successful and erroneous decoding scenarios.
