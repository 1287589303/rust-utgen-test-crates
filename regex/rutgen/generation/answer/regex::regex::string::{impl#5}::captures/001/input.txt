1. Regex patterns with varying complexity including simple patterns, patterns with named groups, and nested capture groups.
2. Haystack strings that include valid matches, invalid matches, empty strings, and strings with special characters or whitespace.
3. Test cases for edge lengths e.g., empty haystack, single character haystack, and haystack that exactly matches the regex pattern.
4. Strings that do not match the regex pattern to test the `None` return value.
