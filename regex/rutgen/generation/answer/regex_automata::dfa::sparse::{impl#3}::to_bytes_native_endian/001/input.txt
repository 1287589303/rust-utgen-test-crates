Valid input for `DFA::to_bytes_native_endian` should include non-empty DFA instances with valid patterns (e.g., patterns containing alphanumeric characters and optional quantifiers), correctly sized buffers for writing (e.g., size >= 1 byte), and must avoid cases with uninitialized or invalid state configurations (invalid byte sequences and non-UTF-8 patterns).
