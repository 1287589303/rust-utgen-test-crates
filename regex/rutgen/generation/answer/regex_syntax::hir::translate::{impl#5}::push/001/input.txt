Test input conditions or ranges: Provide various instances of `HirFrame`, including `Expr(Hir)`, `Literal(Vec<u8>)`, `ClassUnicode(hir::ClassUnicode)`, `ClassBytes(hir::ClassBytes)`, `Repetition`, `Group { old_flags: Flags }`, `Concat`, `Alternation`, and `AlternationBranch`, ensuring to cover cases with empty and non-empty vectors for `Literal`, as well as differing flag states for `Group`.
