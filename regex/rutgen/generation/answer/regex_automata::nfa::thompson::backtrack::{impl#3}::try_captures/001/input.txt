Valid input haystack strings should be of varying lengths from 0 to the maximum limit defined by `BoundedBacktracker::max_haystack_len`, and should include formats compliant with the regex pattern `r"^([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})$"`; invalid formats should also be tested, along with scenarios of matching `caps` being provided, and conditions with varying values for `cache`.
