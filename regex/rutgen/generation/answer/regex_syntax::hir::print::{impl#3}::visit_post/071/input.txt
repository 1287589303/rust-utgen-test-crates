*hir.kind() matches one of HirKind::Empty, HirKind::Literal(_), HirKind::Class(_), HirKind::Look(_) in all combinations, while ensuring at least one case of HirKind::Repetition(ref x) meets conditions with (min, max) pairs like (0, Some(1)), (0, None), (1, None), and (1, Some(1)) with greedy = true/false, verifying Ok(()) is returned in each case.
