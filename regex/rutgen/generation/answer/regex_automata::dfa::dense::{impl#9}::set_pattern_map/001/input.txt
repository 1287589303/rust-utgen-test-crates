map must be a non-empty BTreeMap<StateID, Vec<PatternID>> where keys are valid StateID values and values are non-empty Vec<PatternID>, and also include scenarios with empty Vec<PatternID>, and a scenario where map has MaxSize entries; test for performance changes with very large map sizes as additional boundary cases.
