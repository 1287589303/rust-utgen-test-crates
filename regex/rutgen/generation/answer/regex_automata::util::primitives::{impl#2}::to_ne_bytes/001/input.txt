The input conditions or ranges for the `to_ne_bytes` function should include instances of `SmallIndex` initialized with valid values, specifically: SmallIndex initialized with 0, SmallIndex initialized with the maximum value (u32::MAX), and SmallIndex initialized with the median value (u32::MAX / 2) along with non-checked construction for boundary values, ensuring coverage for zero and edge scenarios of integer values.
