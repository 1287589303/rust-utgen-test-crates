valid PikeVM instances with NFA patterns of varying complexities, ensuring the group length can produce a non-overflowing slots_per_state when multiplied by 2; the NFA must have between 1 to 128 states for diverse coverage; test both empty patterns and maximal length patterns; assess performance with a minimum value of 1 for slots to ensure proper table resizing behavior when initializing an empty table
