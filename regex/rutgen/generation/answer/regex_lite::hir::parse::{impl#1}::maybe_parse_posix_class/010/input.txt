the pattern must start with `[:]` and end with `:]`, and contain valid POSIX class names between the colons, allowing for characters that do not form a valid POSIX class or valid names can be included, e.g., `[[:alnum:]A]`, while ensuring it contains no leading `^`, and can include combinations of valid POSIX classes, such as `[[:lower:]:[:upper:]]`
