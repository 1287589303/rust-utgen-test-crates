stride2 should be tested with input conditions where stride2 is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the alphabet length; valid ranges for alphabet length: 1 to 256, with stride2 values as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256; also include boundary tests for alphabet lengths just below and above powers of 2 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 15, 17, 31, 33, 63, 65, 127, 129, 255, 257).
