char input in the ranges of valid Unicode characters, including but not limited to alphabetic (U+0041 to U+007A), join control (various code points), decimal numbers (U+0030 to U+0039), marks (U+0300 to U+036F), and connector punctuation (U+005F), and ensure to include boundary cases, such as characters immediately preceding and following these ranges (U+003F, U+0040, U+007B for example); test also for cases when the 'unicode-perl' feature is disabled by checking for the expected error response.
