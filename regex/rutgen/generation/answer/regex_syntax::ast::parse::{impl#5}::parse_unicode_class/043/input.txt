self.char() in {'p', 'P'} followed by valid sequences for Unicode classes such as '\p{Greek}', '\p{scx:Katakana}', '\p{scx!=Cyrillic}', single character classes like '\pN' or invalid sequences like '\p{', '\p{}', and malformed escapes like '\p\\'; ensuring cases that test EOF and boundary conditions for input length, including empty and maximum length strings.
