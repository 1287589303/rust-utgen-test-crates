The test input conditions or ranges should include a variety of cases demonstrating the sorting behavior of the literals, including: a non-empty sequence with distinct literal strings, a sequence with identical strings, a sequence with strings of varying lengths, a sequence that is already sorted, a sequence with prefix relationships (e.g., ["samwise", "sam"]), and an edge case with a single literal.
