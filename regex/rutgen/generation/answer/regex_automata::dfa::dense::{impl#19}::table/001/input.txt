test input conditions/ranges: test with a valid `StartTable<T>` containing 0, 1, and multiple `u32` values in `table`, ensuring compatibility with both owned and borrowed references, and checking behavior with various `stride` values (including edge values like `0`, `1`, and the maximum possible aligned size).
