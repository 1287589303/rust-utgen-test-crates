capacity() should return a usize which is non-negative and represents the length of the dense Vec, hence test input conditions should cover values of capacity from 0 to a predefined upper limit (e.g., 1 to 2^16-1) and check edge cases like newly created SparseSet, sparse populated SparseSet, and full SparseSet scenarios.
