- Test input conditions: `&[P]` where `P: AsRef<str>` includes valid patterns (e.g., non-empty strings, special characters, patterns of varying lengths), empty patterns (e.g., `[]`), and patterns that may contain conflicting regex conditions (e.g., `["[a-z]+", "[A-Z]+"]`), including edge cases of single character patterns and excessively long patterns (e.g., `&["a", "b", "c", ..., "z", "12345678901234567890"]`).
