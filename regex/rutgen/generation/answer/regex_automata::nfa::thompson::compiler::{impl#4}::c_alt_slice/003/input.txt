exprs contains at least two elements where all elements are of type `hir::Hir` with `*expr.kind()` being `hir::HirKind::Literal(hir::Literal(_))` and `self.is_reverse()` returns true, ensuring that the length of exprs is equal to literal_count, making literal_count <= 1 and literal_count < exprs.len() both false.
