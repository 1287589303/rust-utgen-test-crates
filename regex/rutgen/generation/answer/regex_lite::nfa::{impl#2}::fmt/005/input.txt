Test input conditions or ranges: pattern must be a non-empty string, states must contain at least one valid State instance, each state must have a defined target StateID, and the memory_extra must be a non-negative integer; also consider edge cases where the pattern is a single character, states contain one state, and all states are of type Match or Fail.
