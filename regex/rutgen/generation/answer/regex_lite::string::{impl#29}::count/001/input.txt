self.it must be a valid enumerator over nfa::CaptureNames<'c>, which should contain zero or more captured matches, thus test input conditions should range from an empty capture names list to a larger list with varying lengths up to the maximum size supported by the implementation. Consider edge cases where capture groups are absent or where all capture groups match the input string, including scenarios for strings with no matches and invalid input strings.
