Test Input Conditions: f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_> must be initialized; self.states() must return an empty iterator; self.starts() must return an empty iterator; f.alternate() must return false; self.st.stride must be greater than 0; anchored must match Anchored::Pattern(pid) where pid is non-null; any outputs from writeln! must simulate Result type, at least one of which fails.
