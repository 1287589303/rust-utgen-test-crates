test input conditions or ranges: f should be a valid formatter, self must have no states (so states() returns an empty iterator), starts() must return a non-empty collection to fulfill the enumeration condition, self.pattern_len() is greater than 1, ms must have a length greater than 0, ensure f.alternate() returns false, and self.ms.pattern_id_slice(i) should yield at least one valid pattern ID for output.
