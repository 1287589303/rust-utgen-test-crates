Valid inputs: non-empty iterable `pattern_groups` with each outer element being iterable containing at least one `Option<String>` (first being None), each subsequent `Option<String>` may hold `Some(name)` or `None`, where `name` must be unique within the corresponding outer iterable, and total number of outer elements does not exceed u32 for `PatternID`; additionally, test for empty or over-limit counts (0 for empty).
