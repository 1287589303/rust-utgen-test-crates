Valid test input conditions include: 
- An instance of `Accels<A>` with an empty `accels` array (i.e., `A` containing zero elements, such as `&[]` or `Vec::new()`) which ensures `self.iter()` returns false. 
- An instance of `Accels<A>` where length-prefixed slice does not exceed ACCEL_CAP but has values that do not affect the outcome of list finishing.
