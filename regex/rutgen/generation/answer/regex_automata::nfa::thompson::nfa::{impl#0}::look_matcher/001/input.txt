Valid test input conditions or ranges for `self` could be: instantiate NFA with various patterns (empty string, single character, multi-character patterns, special characters, Unicode characters) using `NFA::new(pattern)` method with valid and invalid inputs, check if `LookMatcher` is properly initialized, and verify configurations with valid `Builder` settings (including custom line terminators) to ensure it handles all cases correctly, including boundary cases like an empty pattern or a very long pattern.
