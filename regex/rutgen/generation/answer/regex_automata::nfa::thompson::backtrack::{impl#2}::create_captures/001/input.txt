valid `BoundedBacktracker` instance with a corresponding `NFA` that has valid `GroupInfo` to create `Captures` with non-empty slots, ensuring that `bounded_backtracker.get_nfa().group_info().slot_len()` is greater than zero, and test with different patterns including edge cases like empty strings or special characters.
