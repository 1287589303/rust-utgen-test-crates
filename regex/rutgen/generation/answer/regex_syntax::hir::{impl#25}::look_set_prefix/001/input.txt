self.0.look_set_prefix should return instances of LookSet with all bits set to 0, bits set to 32 (maximum u32), and various combinations of bits covering the range from 0 to 32; properties should have utf8 true and false, minimum_len as None and valid usize values (0 through arbitrary large numbers), maximum_len as None and valid usize values (0 through arbitrary large numbers), literal true and false, alternation_literal true and false, and explicit_captures_len with valid usize values (0 through arbitrary large numbers)
