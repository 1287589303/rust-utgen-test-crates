HirKind: Class(hir::Class::Bytes) with ranges populated with pairs (start, end) where start <= end, HirKind: Class(hir::Class::Unicode) with ranges populated with pairs (start, end) where start <= end, HirKind: Literal(hir::Literal(ref bytes)) with byte slices of various lengths, including empty (0 bytes), single byte (1 byte), and multiple bytes (2+ bytes), and ensuring cls.ranges() is empty for testing respective edge cases.
