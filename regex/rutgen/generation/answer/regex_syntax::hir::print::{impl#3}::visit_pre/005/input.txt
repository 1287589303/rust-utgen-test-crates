Hir should be constructed with HirKind::Capture containing a valid name (e.g., Some("capture_name")) while ensuring the writer can handle error scenarios, including testing with an empty name (None) and a valid writer interface that may lead to a write error (e.g., simulating an overflow or other failures in fmt::Write).
