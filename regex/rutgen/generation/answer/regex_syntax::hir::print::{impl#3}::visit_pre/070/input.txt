HirKind::Class(hir::Class::Bytes(ref cls)) with non-empty ranges, cls.iter() returns at least one range where range.start() != range.end() and u32::from(range.start()) + 1 == u32::from(range.end()), ensuring that both write_literal_char calls succeed, ultimately returning Ok(()) after writing "[" and "]".
