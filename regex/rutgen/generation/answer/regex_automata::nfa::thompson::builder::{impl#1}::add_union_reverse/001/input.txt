Self must have a valid state representation, alternates must be a non-empty vector that can contain unique StateIDs, the limit of states must not be exceeded, and the total heap memory usage must not exceed the size limit if set. Valid test input conditions include: alternates as an empty vector, a single element vector, a vector at the maximum allowed length of StateIDs, vectors with duplicate StateIDs, vectors exceeding the maximum StateIDs, and states representing the maximum heap memory limit.
