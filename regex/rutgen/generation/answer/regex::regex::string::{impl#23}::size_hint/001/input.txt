haystack must be a non-empty string or byte slice, and it should contain at least one splitting character; expected return values are (0, None) for empty haystacks and (n, Some(m)) where n is the number of splits and m is the maximum number of splits, covering cases with 0, 1, and multiple splitting characters.
