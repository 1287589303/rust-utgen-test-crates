Ast::Repetition with valid repetition operation and a valid internal Ast structure, Ast::Group with non-empty span and valid Ast, Ast::Concat with at least one non-empty Ast, or Ast::Alternation with at least one non-empty Ast, ensuring all types involve valid span parameters while also testing edge cases like empty asts or nested structures within repetitions and groups.
