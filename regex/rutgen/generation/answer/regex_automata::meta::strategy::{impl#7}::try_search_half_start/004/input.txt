haystack as non-empty byte array, valid span with start < end, cache as mutable Cache, input that results in Some(span) from self.pre.find(input.haystack(), span), inputs leading to Ok/Some from self.try_search_half_rev_limited, inputs leading to None from self.try_search_half_rev_limited for edge case scenarios where span.start becomes equal to span.end
