Valid range of Input for try_search: Input with haystack of non-empty bytes, span covering valid byte indices, start position 0 to length-1, end position from start to length, anchored mode as Unanchored, and earliest set to false; test patterns ensuring fwd.try_search_fwd returns Ok/Some and rev.try_search_rev returns Ok/Some, while also ensuring input.start() != end.offset().
