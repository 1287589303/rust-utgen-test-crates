slice must be a &[u8] with length >= 4 for valid conversion to StartKind, slice where the first 4 bytes correspond to valid u32 values (specifically, 0, 1, or 2 for StartKind variants), and edge case slices such as empty slices, slices with less than 4 bytes, and slices where u32 value is not recognized (greater than 2 or non-numeric).
