slice must be a &[u8] containing at least 8 bytes where the first 4 bytes are valid u32 representing a recognized StartKind and the next 4 bytes are valid for creating a StartByteMap; ensure that the slice length is exactly 8 + (2 * stride * PatternID::LIMIT) to prevent buffer overflows or mismatched sizes.
