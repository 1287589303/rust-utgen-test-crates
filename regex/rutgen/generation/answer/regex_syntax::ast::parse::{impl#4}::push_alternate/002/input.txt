test input conditions: input string must contain at least one alternation operator '|' at a position where the current parser state allows it, ensuring that before the call to push_alternate(), the character at the current position is '|' and that the parser is not at the end of input; the ast.Concat must have its span properly set to reflect valid positions in the input; also consider scenarios with nested alternations and an empty `ast` list within the `concat` to test edge cases.
