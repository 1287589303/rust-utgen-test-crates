Input with a valid `dfa` that returns a valid start state, an `Input` with a valid haystack of at least one element, a `Prefilter` with a valid implementation that is not fast and has a maximum needle length optionally set, and a specified `earliest` boolean value; haystack should not be empty and span must be valid without triggering any out-of-bounds errors.
