The input conditions or ranges for testing the `contains_anchor_crlf` function should ensure that `self.bits` includes the bits corresponding to `Look::StartCRLF` (i.e., 16) and optionally include or exclude `Look::EndCRLF` (i.e., 32), thus testing combinations where one or both are true within a valid range of `u32` values.
