test input conditions or ranges: input strings with characters that could be escaped (e.g., '\\', 'a', '1', '-', etc.), input strings with adjacent characters (e.g., 'a-', '-b', 'c-d'), input strings with invalid escaping (e.g., '\x', '\u', etc.), input strings with unclosed character classes (e.g., '[a-z'), input strings that contain more than one character class (e.g., '[a-z][A-Z]'), and input strings with varying valid and invalid ranges (e.g., 'a-z', '9-1').
