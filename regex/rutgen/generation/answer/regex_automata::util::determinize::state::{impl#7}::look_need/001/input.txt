self.repr must be a valid Vec<u8> with at least 6 bytes to avoid index out of bounds and ensure LookSet can be constructed from bytes, therefore test input conditions should include: Vec<u8> with length < 6, Vec<u8> with length = 6, Vec<u8> with length > 6, and the number of unique Look values fitting within the range of u16 encoded.
