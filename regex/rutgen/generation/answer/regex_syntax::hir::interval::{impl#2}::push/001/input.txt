interval must be a valid instance of type I that implements the Interval trait, including non-empty ranges, boundaries that follow the condition lower <= upper, and potentially varied characteristics for case folding; consider intervals where lower and upper are identical for edge cases (e.g., single item intervals), ranges that overlap, touch each other, or are completely separate, and extreme values like minimum and maximum bounds, using a variety of lower and upper bounds that demonstrate contiguous and non-contiguous relationships.
