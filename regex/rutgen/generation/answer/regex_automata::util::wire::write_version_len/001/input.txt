The function does not take any parameters and is expected to return a `usize`, which represents the size in bytes of a `u32`. As such, the test input conditions or ranges would focus purely on verifying the return type under various compilation configurations. 

Test input conditions or ranges: Verify that the function `write_version_len()` returns 4 under both little-endian and big-endian architectures.
