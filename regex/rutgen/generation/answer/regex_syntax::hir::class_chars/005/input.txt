The input conditions or ranges should include a vector of `Hir` instances where each instance satisfies that it is either a `Class` of `Unicode` or a `Class` of `Bytes` that can convert to `Unicode`, ensuring at least one is present to yield a valid result; specifically, provide test cases with multiple `Hir` objects where ranges of `ClassUnicodeRange` or `ClassBytesRange` represent valid Unicode characters and ASCII bytes, including edge cases with empty classes or full range classes.
