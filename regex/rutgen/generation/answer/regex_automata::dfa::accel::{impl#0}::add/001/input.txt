Input conditions to test the `add` function must include: an `Accel` instance with valid byte arrays containing various combinations of byte values (including edge cases of all zeros and all maximum values), accels vector length from 0 to `AccelTy::MAX` inclusive, ensuring that the addition of `Accel` does not exceed the maximum length constraint.
