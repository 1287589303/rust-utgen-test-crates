Test input conditions or ranges: provide a minimum of zero patterns ([]) up to a maximum of 1000 valid regex patterns including various regex syntaxes (e.g., valid character classes, groups, lookaheads, Unicode properties, and any combinations that can trigger syntax errors) while ensuring patterns include edge cases like empty strings, overly complex patterns, and patterns that lead to parsing errors for testing error handling.
