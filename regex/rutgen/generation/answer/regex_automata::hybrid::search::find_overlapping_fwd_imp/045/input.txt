state.id is None, input.haystack is not empty, input.start() < input.end(), dfa has valid states, cache is a valid mutable reference, input.haystack()[state.at] causes next_state to return Err, state.at is initialized from input.start() to less than input.end() before line 505, and sid is derived from a successful call to init_fwd.
