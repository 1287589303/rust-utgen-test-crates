dfa: &DFA instance with valid configuration, cache: &mut Cache instance, input: &Input<'_> with haystack of valid non-empty bytes, pre: Option<&'_ Prefilter> with Some valid pre-filter, state: &mut OverlappingState initialized with state.id as None, input.start() within valid range, input.end() greater than input.start() but equal or less than haystack length, haystack content ensuring that next_state transitions successfully and tagged states are reachable, span within bounds of input, and span.start > state.at where state.at equals input.end().
