dfa is a valid DFA instance, cache is a mutable Cache instance, input is a valid Input<'_> instance with haystack length > 0, pre is None, state is an OverlappingState with id as None, at < input.end(), and sid is a valid LazyStateID at a point where .next_state(cache, sid, input.haystack()[state.at]) must return Ok/Some without being tagged and at the end, ensuring state.mat is None.
