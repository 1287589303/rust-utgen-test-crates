- haystack: a non-empty string of any length, valid UTF-8, with at least one matching substring for the regex pattern; 
- it: an iterator over capture groups must be initialized and must contain at least one element of type `captures::CapturesPatternIter<'c>`; 
- start and end: non-negative integers representing valid indices within the bounds of the haystack string; 
- expected return: either `Some(Some(Match))` when there is a match, `Some(None)` when there are no more matches, or `None` if the iterator is exhausted.
