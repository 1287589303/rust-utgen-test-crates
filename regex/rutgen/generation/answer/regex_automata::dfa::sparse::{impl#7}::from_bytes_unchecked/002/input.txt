slice must be a &[u8] of length at least 256 with valid u32 representations for the state length and valid data for the pattern length; the content should allow for valid parsing in lines 1306 and 1310 respectively, e.g., first 4 bytes for state length, followed by 4 bytes for pattern length that trigger an error in the parsing process.
