slice should contain at least 4 bytes for state length, at least 4 bytes for pattern length, at least 256 bytes for ByteClasses, and at least 4 bytes for sparse transitions length, making the minimum length of slice 268 bytes while also ensuring that the number of remaining bytes after reading each section is valid and does not lead to an out-of-bounds error.
