test input conditions or ranges: `bytes` should contain a byte sequence that matches an existing entry in the trie and is a prefix of a byte sequence to be inserted, where the state has at least one transition and its match state is set (e.g., `bytes` = `[existing_byte]` with `existing_byte` corresponding to a state that has `matches[prev]` as `Some(NonZeroUsize::new(existing_index))`).
