self.0 must be an Option<ReverseDFAEngine> that can be None or Some, and if it is Some, the inner e must have a valid memory_usage() method returning a usize value; therefore, test input conditions include: test with self.0 as None, test with self.0 as Some returning a memory_usage of 0, and test with self.0 as Some returning a memory_usage of a non-zero usize.
