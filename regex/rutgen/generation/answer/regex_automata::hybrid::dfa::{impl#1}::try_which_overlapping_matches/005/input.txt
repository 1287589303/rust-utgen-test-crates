Valid input patterns for `patterns` must match expected regex types, while the `input` must provide a string of bytes; `patset` must be valid with sufficient capacity (greater than or equal to the pattern count); `cache` should support concurrent searches; ensure `state` starts from a reset condition with a default initialized `OverlappingState`, and test with varying lengths of `input` from 0 to a maximum expected length.
