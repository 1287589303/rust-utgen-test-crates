self and other must both contain at least one StateID, self must contain unique StateIDs, other must contain unique StateIDs, there must be overlapping values between self and other such that a == b condition is not met at any iteration in the loop; specifically, values in self must be greater than those in other; additional test for StateIDs in self to exhaust all elements without finding corresponding elements in other at the end of the iteration.
