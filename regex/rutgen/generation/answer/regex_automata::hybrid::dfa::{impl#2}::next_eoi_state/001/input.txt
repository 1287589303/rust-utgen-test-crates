1. Test `LazyStateID` values where `current` is valid and corresponds to a state ID that can transition, ensuring `sid.is_unknown()` is true; test using `current` values that are at least `SENTINEL_STATES + 2` to `LazyStateID::MAX`, and test `cache.trans` array with indices including boundary cases to ensure indexing does not go out of bounds; test `self.classes.eoi().as_usize()` returning values from 0 to `SENTINEL_STATES` ensuring valid transitions when `eoi` is added to the `current` state.
