u8 byte array including various valid UTF-8 sequences (e.g., valid ASCII, two-byte sequences like [0xc2, 0xa9], three-byte sequences like [0xe2, 0x9c, 0x94], and single-byte sequences including control characters, and one instance of byte 0) along with at least one invalid byte (like [0xff]) for boundary scenarios, ensuring total length allows for decoding attempts.
