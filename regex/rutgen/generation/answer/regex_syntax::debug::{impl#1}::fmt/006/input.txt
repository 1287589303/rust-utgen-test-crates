Input ranges should include empty byte arrays, valid UTF-8 byte sequences, and byte sequences with invalid UTF-8 characters (like 0xFF); specifically test with character ranges including control characters (e.g., 0x01-0x08, 0x0B-0x0C, 0x0E-0x19, 0x7F) mixed with valid UTF-8 bytes, single-byte values, multi-byte characters, and edge cases involving sequences at the boundary of valid UTF-8 encoding.
