Test input conditions or ranges: Non-empty byte arrays containing valid UTF-8 characters, arrays including edge UTF-8 sequences (e.g., invalid byte sequences like 0x80, 0xC0, 0xFF), arrays containing ASCII control characters, arrays that include multiple null bytes, and a final input case with an empty byte array.
