Valid test input conditions include pattern strings of varying lengths, including empty strings, strings containing special regex characters, and strings that may exceed typical regex limits. The input must also ensure that the construction of the regex does not cause a BuildError. Additionally, the patterns should include cases with and without number ranges (e.g., "foo[0-9]+bar", "validregex*", "invalid*("), and edge cases with very long or complex patterns.
