StateID values in the range of valid indices based on self.alphabet_len() for the remap function, including boundary cases (e.g., 0, self.alphabet_len() - 1); mapping function that may return StateID within expected transitions, and scenarios where the mapping function has no effect or adverse effects (e.g., returning the original ID).
