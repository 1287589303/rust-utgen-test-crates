Test input conditions or ranges: test with an empty regex set, test with a single regex pattern, test with multiple regex patterns (2 to n), ensure regex patterns are valid (e.g., matching structure), test with patterns that have maximum length allowed by the system, test with combinations of different patterns that match or don't match input strings, test with input strings that have varying lengths and characters.
