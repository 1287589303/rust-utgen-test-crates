dst must be a mutable slice of at least 64 bytes and should contain valid data to satisfy wire::write_label, wire::write_endianness_check, wire::write_version, self.flags.write_to, and self.tt.write_to with successful results, while self.st.write_to should encounter an error due to insufficient state IDs or patterns.
