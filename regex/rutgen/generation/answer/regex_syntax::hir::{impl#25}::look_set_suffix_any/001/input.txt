Test input conditions or ranges: Properties with varied combinations of minimum_len (None, 0, positive integers), maximum_len (None, 0, positive integers), utf8 (true, false), explicit_captures_len (0, positive integers), static_explicit_captures_len (None, 0, positive integers), literal (true, false), alternation_literal (true, false), and all possible values for look_set_suffix_any as a valid LookSet with bits ranging from 0 to 0xFFFF.
