slice: &[u8] with length >= minimum valid bytes for DFA serialization, endianness matching target platform, u32 aligned, valid accelerator index between 0 and number of accelerators (inclusive), and accelerator needles length ranging from 1 to 3 (inclusive) for each accelerator; plus various valid DFA structure checks (transition table, start table, match states, accelerators).
