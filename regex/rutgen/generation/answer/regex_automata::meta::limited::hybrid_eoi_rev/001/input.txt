Input `Input<'_>` with `haystack` containing at least one byte, `span` where `start` is greater than 0 and `end` is greater than `start`, `sid` should be a valid `LazyStateID`, `cache` must be properly initialized, and we should expect a `MatchError` indicating a gave up scenario or an error on next state computation.
