Test input conditions or ranges: bytes must be a non-empty slice containing valid UTF-8 encoded sequences, specifically leading with a single-byte character (0x00 to 0x7F) or a multi-byte character that is correctly encoded starting with 0xC2 to 0xF4, ensuring that the byte length matches the defined UTF-8 character length requirements without exceeding the slice length.
