Input must be a non-empty byte slice of `&[u8]`, `span` must be valid with `start < end`, anchored must be false, prefilter must successfully find a valid prefix span within the haystack, the DFA configuration must not utilize the universal start state, and search must lead to a valid match in the state transitions ensuring to cover cases that return Ok with a valid HalfMatch when `earliest` is true.
