input: Input<'_> with haystack of at least one byte, PatternSet with capacity matching dfa.pattern_len(), state initialized from OverlappingState::start() leading to at least one matching pattern during overlapping search that does not cause patset to be full or input to have earliest as true before insert; testing against different pattern lengths and various edge cases such as empty haystack, all patterns matching, no patterns matching, and maximum capacity of PatternSet.
