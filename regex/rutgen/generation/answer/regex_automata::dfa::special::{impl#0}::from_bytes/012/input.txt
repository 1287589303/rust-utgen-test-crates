slice length must be at least 8 * StateID::SIZE and each StateID should be within a valid range; max must be non-negative, quit_id must be less than max, min_match, max_match, min_accel, max_accel, min_start, max_start must be less than or equal to max, and min_match <= max_match, min_accel <= max_accel, min_start <= max_start with validation checks for DEAD state conditions and quit_id not exceeding respective min values
