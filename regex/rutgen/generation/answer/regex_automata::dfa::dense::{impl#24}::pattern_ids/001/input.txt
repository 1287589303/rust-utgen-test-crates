self.pattern_ids should be a non-empty slice of u32 with length between 1 and 10, inclusive, containing valid u32 values; test cases should cover edge cases like minimum (1) and maximum (10) lengths, and ensure no out of bounds access occurs when accessing elements in the resulting slice of PatternID.
