Valid test inputs for the `pattern_len` function are: a `Regex` instance created with a single pattern (e.g., `r"abc"`), a `Regex` instance created with multiple patterns (e.g., `["a", "b", "c"]`), and a `Regex` instance created with no patterns (e.g., `&[]`), covering patterns of length 0, 1, and multiple patterns; conditions should validate expected return values of 0, 1, and n respectively, where n is the number of patterns.
