Valid test input conditions include a range of `u8` values from 0 to 255 to cover all possible byte values, including cases where the default line terminator (if applicable) is `'\n'` (value 10), and also include tests where no line terminator has been explicitly set (case for expected return value to be default `'\n'`).
