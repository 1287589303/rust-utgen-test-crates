hirs must contain exactly 1 HIR expression, the HIR expression must represent a top-level concatenation, concat must contain at least 2 elements, the second element in concat must yield a valid prefilter that is fast, concat_suffix must yield a valid prefilter that is not fast, and the expected return type is Some((Hir, Prefilter)).
