Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3. Only generate necessary test oracles to ensure comprehensive validation.\n",

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow when building a finite automaton from a regular expression's\n/// abstract syntax tree. In particular, construction currently uses\n/// recursion. In the future, the implementation may stop using recursion\n/// and this option will no longer be necessary.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire AST is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since the parser will\n/// limit itself to heap space proportional to the length of the pattern\n/// string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation AST item, which results\n/// in a nest depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that\n/// manifests in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it\n/// should not be used in a granular way.\n357 pub fn nest_limit(mut self, limit: u32) -> Config {\n358     self.nest_limit = limit;\n359     self\n360 }\n\nThe path conditions that the generated test functions should satisfy are as follows:\n"
