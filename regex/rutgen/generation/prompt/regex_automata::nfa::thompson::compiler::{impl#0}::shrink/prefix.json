  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines, focusing solely on constructing test inputs and calling the functions under test:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions, and reference the inferred test input conditions or ranges.\n7. Ensure the test inputs are designed to cover the inferred test input conditions or ranges as comprehensively as possible, with particular emphasis on boundary cases.\n8. Focus on crafting test inputs that effectively reveal potential bugs while meeting the specified requirements.\n9. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls.\n10. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

In other words, enabling this\n/// can substantially decrease the overall amount of time it takes to build\n/// a DFA.\n///\n/// A reason to keep this disabled is if you want to compile an NFA and\n/// start using it as quickly as possible without needing to build a DFA,\n/// and you don't mind using a bit of extra memory for the NFA. e.g., for\n/// an NFA simulation or for a lazy DFA.\n///\n/// NFA shrinking is currently most useful when compiling a reverse\n/// NFA with large Unicode character classes. In particular, it trades\n/// additional CPU time during NFA compilation in favor of generating fewer\n/// NFA states.\n///\n/// This is disabled by default because it can increase compile times\n/// quite a bit if you aren't building a full DFA.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// This example shows that NFA shrinking can lead to substantial space\n/// savings in some cases. Notice that, as noted above, we build a reverse\n/// DFA and use a pattern with a large Unicode character class.\n///\n/// ```\n/// # if cfg!(miri) { return Ok(()); } // miri takes too long\n/// use regex_automata::nfa::thompson::{NFA, WhichCaptures};\n///\n/// // Currently we have to disable captures when enabling reverse NFA.\n/// let config = NFA::config()\n///     .which_captures(WhichCaptures::None)\n///     .reverse(true);\n/// let not_shrunk = NFA::compiler()\n///     .configure(config.clone().shrink(false))\n///     .build(r\"\\w\")?;\n/// let shrunk = NFA::compiler()\n///     .configure(config.clone().shrink(true))\n///     .build(r\"\\w\")?;\n///\n/// // While a specific shrink factor is not guaranteed, the savings can be\n/// // considerable in some cases.\n/// assert!(shrunk.states().len() * 2 < not_shrunk.states().len());\n///\n/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())\n/// ```\n302 pub fn shrink(mut self, yes: bool) -> Config {\n303     self.shrink = Some(yes);\n304     self\n305 }\n\nGenerate each test function in such a manner that it concurrently satisfies all the following preconditions:\n",
