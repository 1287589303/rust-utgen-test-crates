Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3. Only generate necessary test oracles to ensure comprehensive validation.\n",

Moreover, the _order_ of the sequence returned corresponds to\n/// the preference order.\n///\n/// Suffixes satisfy a similar contract in that every match of the\n/// corresponding `Hir` must end with one of the literals in the sequence\n/// returned. However, there is no guarantee that the literals are in\n/// preference order.\n///\n/// Remember that a sequence can be infinite. For example, unless the\n/// limits are configured to be impractically large, attempting to extract\n/// prefixes (or suffixes) for the pattern `[A-Z]` will return an infinite\n/// sequence.
