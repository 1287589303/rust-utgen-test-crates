In\n/// particular, minimization has worst case `O(n*k*logn)` time and `O(k*n)`\n/// space, where `n` is the number of DFA states and `k` is the alphabet\n/// size. In practice, minimization can be quite costly in terms of both\n/// space and time, so it should only be done if you're willing to wait\n/// longer to produce a DFA. In general, you might want a minimal DFA in\n/// the following circumstances:\n///\n/// 1. You would like to optimize for the size of the automaton. This can\n///    manifest in one of two ways. Firstly, if you're converting the\n///    DFA into Rust code (or a table embedded in the code), then a minimal\n///    DFA will translate into a corresponding reduction in code  size, and\n///    thus, also the final compiled binary size. Secondly, if you are\n///    building many DFAs and putting them on the heap, you'll be able to\n///    fit more if they are smaller. Note though that building a minimal\n///    DFA itself requires additional space; you only realize the space\n///    savings once the minimal DFA is constructed (at which point, the\n///    space used for minimization is freed).\n/// 2. You've observed that a smaller DFA results in faster match\n///    performance. Naively, this isn't guaranteed since there is no\n///    inherent difference between matching with a bigger-than-minimal\n///    DFA and a minimal DFA. However, a smaller DFA may make use of your\n///    CPU's cache more efficiently.\n/// 3. You are trying to establish an equivalence between regular\n///    languages. The standard method for this is to build a minimal DFA\n///    for each language and then compare them. If the DFAs are equivalent\n///    (up to state renaming), then the languages are equivalent.\n///\n/// Typically, minimization only makes sense as an offline process. That\n/// is, one might minimize a DFA before serializing it to persistent\n/// storage. In practical terms, minimization can take around an order of\n/// magnitude more time than compiling the initial DFA via determinization.\n///\n/// This option is disabled by default.\n246 pub fn minimize(mut self, yes: bool) -> Config {\n247     self.minimize = Some(yes);\n248     self\n249 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
