If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an `Ast` using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire Ast is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser\n/// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the\n/// length of the pattern string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest\n/// depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that manifests\n/// in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it should not be\n/// used in a granular way.\n66 pub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n67     self.ast.nest_limit(limit);\n68     self\n69 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
