Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3.

It tends to\n/// adopt the performance profile of a fully build DFA, but without the\n/// downside of taking worst case exponential time to build.\n///\n/// The downside is that it needs to keep a cache of transitions and\n/// states that are built while running a search, and this cache\n/// can fill up. When it fills up, the cache will reset itself. Any\n/// previously generated states and transitions will then need to be\n/// re-generated. If this happens too many times, then this library\n/// will bail out of using the lazy DFA and switch to a different regex\n/// engine.\n///\n/// If your regex provokes this particular downside of the lazy DFA,\n/// then it may be beneficial to increase its cache capacity. This will\n/// potentially reduce the frequency of cache resetting (ideally to\n/// `0`). While it won't fix all potential performance problems with\n/// the lazy DFA, increasing the cache capacity does fix some.\n///\n/// There is no easy way to determine, a priori, whether increasing\n/// this cache capacity will help. In general, the larger your regex,\n/// the more cache it's likely to use. But that isn't an ironclad rule.\n/// For example, a regex like `[01]*1[01]{N}` would normally produce a\n/// fully build DFA that is exponential in size with respect to `N`.\n/// The lazy DFA will prevent exponential space blow-up, but it cache\n/// is likely to fill up, even when it's large and even for smallish\n/// values of `N`.\n///\n/// If you aren't sure whether this helps or not, it is sensible to\n/// set this to some arbitrarily large number in testing, such as\n/// `usize::MAX`. Namely, this represents the amount of capacity that\n/// *may* be used. It's probably not a good idea to use `usize::MAX` in\n/// production though, since it implies there are no controls on heap\n/// memory used by this library during a search. In effect, set it to\n/// whatever you're willing to allocate for a single regex search.\n1306 pub fn dfa_size_limit(\n1307     &mut self,\n1308     bytes: usize,\n1309 ) -> &mut RegexSetBuilder {\n1310     self.builder.dfa_size_limit(bytes);\n1311     self\n1312 }\n\nThe path conditions that the generated test functions should satisfy are as follows:\n"
