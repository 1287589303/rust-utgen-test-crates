Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3. Only generate necessary test oracles to ensure comprehensive validation.\n",
