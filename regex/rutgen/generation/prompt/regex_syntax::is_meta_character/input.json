Provide test input conditions or ranges in one line in plain text only, without additional explanations or Markdown formatting\n2. Analyze the function under test, context, preconditions, and expected return values or types to determine appropriate test input conditions or ranges\n3. The inferred test input conditions or ranges should comprehensively satisfy all provided preconditions simultaneously.\n4. Ensure the test input conditions or ranges cover boundary cases and edge scenarios\n",
  "static_pt": "The context for the focal function is as follows:\n// regex-syntax/src/lib.rs\n// crate name is regex_syntax\npub use crate::{\n    error::Error, parser::{parse, Parser, ParserBuilder},\n    unicode::UnicodeWordError,\n};\nuse alloc::string::String;\npub fn is_meta_character(c: char) -> bool {\n    match c {\n        '\\\\' | '.' | '+' | '*' | '?' | '(' | ')' | '|' | '[' | ']' | '{' | '}' | '^'\n        | '$' | '#' | '&' | '-' | '~' => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\n\nThe function to be tested is presented with each line formatted as 'line number + code':\n/// Returns true if the given character has significance in a regex.\n///\n/// Generally speaking, these are the only characters which _must_ be escaped\n/// in order to match their literal meaning. For example, to match a literal\n/// `|`, one could write `\\|`. Sometimes escaping isn't always necessary. For\n/// example, `-` is treated as a meta character because of its significance\n/// for writing ranges inside of character classes, but the regex `-` will\n/// match a literal `-` because `-` has no special meaning outside of character\n/// classes.\n///\n/// In order to determine whether a character may be escaped at all, the\n/// [`is_escapeable_character`] routine should be used. The difference between\n/// `is_meta_character` and `is_escapeable_character` is that the latter will\n/// return true for some characters that are _not_ meta characters. For\n/// example, `%` and `\\%` both match a literal `%` in all contexts. In other\n/// words, `is_escapeable_character` includes \"superfluous\" escapes.\n///\n/// Note that the set of characters for which this function returns `true` or\n/// `false` is fixed and won't change in a semver compatible release. (In this\n/// case, \"semver compatible release\" actually refers to the `regex` crate\n/// itself, since reducing or expanding the set of meta characters would be a\n/// breaking change for not just `regex-syntax` but also `regex` itself.)\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex_syntax::is_meta_character;\n///\n/// assert!(is_meta_character('?'));\n/// assert!(is_meta_character('-'));\n/// assert!(is_meta_character('&'));\n/// assert!(is_meta_character('#'));\n///\n/// assert!(!is_meta_character('%'));\n/// assert!(!is_meta_character('/'));\n/// assert!(!is_meta_character('!'));\n/// assert!(!is_meta_character('\"'));\n/// assert!(!is_meta_character('e'));\n/// ```\n260 pub fn is_meta_character(c: char) -> bool {\n261     match c {\n262         '\\\\' | '.' | '+' | '*' | '?' | '(' | ')' | '|' | '[' | ']' | '{'\n263         | '}' | '^' | '$' | '#' | '&' | '-' | '~' => true,\n264         _ => false,\n265     }\n266 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
