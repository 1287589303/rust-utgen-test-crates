Provide test input conditions or ranges in one line in plain text only, without additional explanations or Markdown formatting\n2. Analyze the function under test, context, preconditions, and expected return values or types to determine appropriate test input conditions or ranges\n3. The inferred test input conditions or ranges should comprehensively satisfy all provided preconditions simultaneously.\n4. Ensure the test input conditions or ranges cover boundary cases and edge scenarios\n",
