Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3.

Each equivalence class represents a\n/// set of bytes that does not discriminate between a match and a non-match\n/// in the DFA. For example, the pattern `[ab]+` has at least two\n/// equivalence classes: a set containing `a` and `b` and a set containing\n/// every byte except for `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are in the same\n/// equivalence class because they never discriminate between a match and a\n/// non-match.\n///\n/// The advantage of this map is that the size of the transition table\n/// can be reduced drastically from (approximately) `#states * 256 *\n/// sizeof(StateID)` to `#states * k * sizeof(StateID)` where `k` is the\n/// number of equivalence classes (rounded up to the nearest power of 2).\n/// As a result, total space usage can decrease substantially. Moreover,\n/// since a smaller alphabet is used, DFA compilation becomes faster as\n/// well.\n///\n/// **WARNING:** This is only useful for debugging DFAs. Disabling this\n/// does not yield any speed advantages. Namely, even when this is\n/// disabled, a byte class map is still used while searching. The only\n/// difference is that every byte will be forced into its own distinct\n/// equivalence class. This is useful for debugging the actual generated\n/// transitions because it lets one see the transitions defined on actual\n/// bytes instead of the equivalence classes.\n188 pub fn byte_classes(mut self, yes: bool) -> Config {\n189     self.byte_classes = Some(yes);\n190     self\n191 }\n\nThe path conditions that the generated test functions should satisfy are as follows:\n"
