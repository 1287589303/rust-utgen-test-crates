  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines, focusing solely on constructing test inputs and calling the functions under test:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions, and reference the inferred test input conditions or ranges.\n7. Ensure the test inputs are designed to cover the inferred test input conditions or ranges as comprehensively as possible, with particular emphasis on boundary cases.\n8. Focus on crafting test inputs that effectively reveal potential bugs while meeting the specified requirements.\n9. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls.\n10. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

Each equivalence class represents a\n/// set of bytes that does not discriminate between a match and a non-match\n/// in the DFA. For example, the pattern `[ab]+` has at least two\n/// equivalence classes: a set containing `a` and `b` and a set containing\n/// every byte except for `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are in the same\n/// equivalence class because they never discriminate between a match and a\n/// non-match.\n///\n/// The advantage of this map is that the size of the transition table\n/// can be reduced drastically from (approximately) `#states * 256 *\n/// sizeof(StateID)` to `#states * k * sizeof(StateID)` where `k` is the\n/// number of equivalence classes (rounded up to the nearest power of 2).\n/// As a result, total space usage can decrease substantially. Moreover,\n/// since a smaller alphabet is used, DFA compilation becomes faster as\n/// well.\n///\n/// **WARNING:** This is only useful for debugging DFAs. Disabling this\n/// does not yield any speed advantages. Namely, even when this is\n/// disabled, a byte class map is still used while searching. The only\n/// difference is that every byte will be forced into its own distinct\n/// equivalence class. This is useful for debugging the actual generated\n/// transitions because it lets one see the transitions defined on actual\n/// bytes instead of the equivalence classes.\n188 pub fn byte_classes(mut self, yes: bool) -> Config {\n189     self.byte_classes = Some(yes);\n190     self\n191 }\n\nGenerate each test function in such a manner that it concurrently satisfies all the following preconditions:\n",
