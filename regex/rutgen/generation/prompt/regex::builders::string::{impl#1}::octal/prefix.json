  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines, focusing solely on constructing test inputs and calling the functions under test:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions, and reference the inferred test input conditions or ranges.\n7. Ensure the test inputs are designed to cover the inferred test input conditions or ranges as comprehensively as possible, with particular emphasis on boundary cases.\n8. Focus on crafting test inputs that effectively reveal potential bugs while meeting the specified requirements.\n9. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls.\n10. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

However, many users expect\n/// backreferences to be supported. Therefore, when octal support\n/// is disabled, the error message will explicitly mention that\n/// backreferences aren't supported.\n///\n/// The default for this is `false`.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex::RegexSetBuilder;\n///\n/// // Normally this pattern would not compile, with an error message\n/// // about backreferences not being supported. But with octal mode\n/// // enabled, octal escape sequences work.\n/// let re = RegexSetBuilder::new([r\"\\141\"])\n///     .octal(true)\n///     .build()\n///     .unwrap();\n/// assert!(re.is_match(\"a\"));\n/// ```\n1219 pub fn octal(&mut self, yes: bool) -> &mut RegexSetBuilder {\n1220     self.builder.octal(yes);\n1221     self\n1222 }\n\nGenerate each test function in such a manner that it concurrently satisfies all the following preconditions:\n",
