Provide test input conditions or ranges in one line in plain text only, without additional explanations or Markdown formatting\n2. Analyze the function under test, context, preconditions, and expected return values or types to determine appropriate test input conditions or ranges\n3.

For example, `a`, `\\x61`, `\\u0061` and `\\141` are all\n/// equivalent patterns, where the last example shows octal syntax.\n///\n/// While supporting octal syntax isn't in and of itself a problem,\n/// it does make good error messages harder. That is, in PCRE based\n/// regex engines, syntax like `\\1` invokes a backreference, which is\n/// explicitly unsupported this library. However, many users expect\n/// backreferences to be supported. Therefore, when octal support\n/// is disabled, the error message will explicitly mention that\n/// backreferences aren't supported.\n///\n/// The default for this is `false`.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex::RegexSetBuilder;\n///\n/// // Normally this pattern would not compile, with an error message\n/// // about backreferences not being supported. But with octal mode\n/// // enabled, octal escape sequences work.\n/// let re = RegexSetBuilder::new([r\"\\141\"])\n///     .octal(true)\n///     .build()\n///     .unwrap();\n/// assert!(re.is_match(\"a\"));\n/// ```\n1219 pub fn octal(&mut self, yes: bool) -> &mut RegexSetBuilder {\n1220     self.builder.octal(yes);\n1221     self\n1222 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
