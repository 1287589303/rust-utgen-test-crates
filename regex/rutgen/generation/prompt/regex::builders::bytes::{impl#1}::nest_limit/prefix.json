  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines, focusing solely on constructing test inputs and calling the functions under test:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions, and reference the inferred test input conditions or ranges.\n7. Ensure the test inputs are designed to cover the inferred test input conditions or ranges as comprehensively as possible, with particular emphasis on boundary cases.\n8. Focus on crafting test inputs that effectively reveal potential bugs while meeting the specified requirements.\n9. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls.\n10. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too\n/// many nested groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an AST using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire AST is parsed.\n/// Therefore, if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap\n/// space used, then they should impose a limit on the length, in\n/// bytes, of the concrete pattern string. In particular, this is\n/// viable since this parser implementation will limit itself to heap\n/// space proportional to the length of the pattern string. See also\n/// the [untrusted inputs](crate#untrusted-input) section in the\n/// top-level crate documentation for more information about this.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for\n/// most patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits\n/// `a` but not `ab`, since `ab` requires an explicit concatenation,\n/// which results in a nest depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is\n/// not something that manifests in an obvious way in the concrete\n/// syntax, therefore, it should not be used in a granular way.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex::bytes::RegexSetBuilder;\n///\n/// assert!(RegexSetBuilder::new([r\"a\"]).nest_limit(0).build().is_ok());\n/// assert!(RegexSetBuilder::new([r\"ab\"]).nest_limit(0).build().is_err());\n/// ```\n2534 pub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut RegexSetBuilder {\n2535     self.builder.nest_limit(limit);\n2536     self\n2537 }\n\nGenerate each test function in such a manner that it concurrently satisfies all the following preconditions:\n",
