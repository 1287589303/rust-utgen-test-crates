If no match exists, then `None` is returned.\n///\n/// This routine is principally only useful when searching for multiple\n/// patterns on inputs where multiple patterns may match the same regions\n/// of text. In particular, callers must preserve the automaton's search\n/// state from prior calls so that the implementation knows where the last\n/// match occurred.\n///\n/// When using this routine to implement an iterator of overlapping\n/// matches, the `start` of the search should remain invariant throughout\n/// iteration. The `OverlappingState` given to the search will keep track\n/// of the current position of the search. (This is because multiple\n/// matches may be reported at the same position, so only the search\n/// implementation itself knows when to advance the position.)\n///\n/// If for some reason you want the search to forget about its previous\n/// state and restart the search at a particular position, then setting the\n/// state to [`OverlappingState::start`] will accomplish that.\n///\n/// # Errors\n///\n/// This routine errors if the search could not complete. This can occur\n/// in a number of circumstances:\n///\n/// * The configuration of the lazy DFA may permit it to \"quit\" the search.\n/// For example, setting quit bytes or enabling heuristic support for\n/// Unicode word boundaries. The default configuration does not enable any\n/// option that could result in the lazy DFA quitting.\n/// * The configuration of the lazy DFA may also permit it to \"give up\"\n/// on a search if it makes ineffective use of its transition table\n/// cache. The default configuration does not enable this by default,\n/// although it is typically a good idea to.\n/// * When the provided `Input` configuration is not supported. For\n/// example, by providing an unsupported anchor mode.\n///\n/// When a search returns an error, callers cannot know whether a match\n/// exists or not.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// This example shows how to run a basic overlapping search. Notice\n/// that we build the automaton with a `MatchKind::All` configuration.\n/// Overlapping searches are unlikely to work as one would expect when\n/// using the default `MatchKind::LeftmostFirst` match semantics, since\n/// leftmost-first matching is fundamentally incompatible with overlapping\n/// searches. Namely, overlapping searches need to report matches as they\n/// are seen, where as leftmost-first searches will continue searching even\n/// after a match has been observed in order to find the conventional end\n/// position of the match. More concretely, leftmost-first searches use\n/// dead states to terminate a search after a specific match can no longer\n/// be extended.
