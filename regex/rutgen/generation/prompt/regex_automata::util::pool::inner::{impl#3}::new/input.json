So we can almost mark this function as const. But of\n460     // course, we're creating a Vec of stacks below (we didn't when I\n461     // originally wrote this code).

Blech.\n481     //\n482     // So then I thought that I could push the box down into this\n483     // type (and leave the non-std version unboxed) and use the same\n484     // `UnsafeCell` technique to lazily initialize it. This has the\n485     // downside of the `Once` now needing to get hit in the owner fast\n486     // path, but maybe that's OK? However, I then realized that we can\n487     // only lazily initialize `stacks`, `owner` and `owner_val`. The\n488     // `create` function needs to be put somewhere outside of the box.\n489     // So now the pool is a `Box`, `Once` and a function. Now we're\n490     // starting to defeat the point of boxing in the first place. So I\n491     // backed out that change too.\n492     //\n493     // Back to square one.
