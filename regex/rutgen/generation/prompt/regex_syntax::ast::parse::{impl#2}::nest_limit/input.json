Provide test input conditions or ranges in one line in plain text only, without additional explanations or Markdown formatting\n2. Analyze the function under test, context, preconditions, and expected return values or types to determine appropriate test input conditions or ranges\n3.

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an `Ast` using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire AST is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser\n/// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the\n/// length of the pattern string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest\n/// depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that manifests\n/// in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it should not be\n/// used in a granular way.\n190 pub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n191     self.nest_limit = limit;\n192     self\n193 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
