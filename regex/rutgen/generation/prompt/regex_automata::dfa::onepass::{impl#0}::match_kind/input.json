That is, when multiple\n/// patterns would match at the same leftmost position, the pattern that\n/// appears first in the concrete syntax is chosen.\n///\n/// Currently, the only other kind of match semantics supported is\n/// [`MatchKind::All`]. This corresponds to \"classical DFA\" construction\n/// where all possible matches are visited.\n///\n/// When it comes to the one-pass DFA, it is rarer for preference order and\n/// \"longest match\" to actually disagree. Since if they did disagree, then\n/// the regex typically isn't one-pass. For example, searching `Samwise`\n/// for `Sam|Samwise` will report `Sam` for leftmost-first matching and\n/// `Samwise` for \"longest match\" or \"all\" matching. However, this regex is\n/// not one-pass if taken literally. The equivalent regex, `Sam(?:|wise)`\n/// is one-pass and `Sam|Samwise` may be optimized to it.\n///\n/// The other main difference is that \"all\" match semantics don't support\n/// non-greedy matches. \"All\" match semantics always try to match as much\n/// as possible.\n102 pub fn match_kind(mut self, kind: MatchKind) -> Config {\n103     self.match_kind = Some(kind);\n104     self\n105 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
