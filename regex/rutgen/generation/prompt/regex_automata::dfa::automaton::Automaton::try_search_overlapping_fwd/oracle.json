Matches, if one exists, can be\n/// obtained via the [`OverlappingState::get_match`] method.\n///\n/// This routine is principally only useful when searching for multiple\n/// patterns on inputs where multiple patterns may match the same regions\n/// of text. In particular, callers must preserve the automaton's search\n/// state from prior calls so that the implementation knows where the last\n/// match occurred.\n///\n/// When using this routine to implement an iterator of overlapping\n/// matches, the `start` of the search should always be set to the end\n/// of the last match. If more patterns match at the previous location,\n/// then they will be immediately returned. (This is tracked by the given\n/// overlapping state.) Otherwise, the search continues at the starting\n/// position given.\n///\n/// If for some reason you want the search to forget about its previous\n/// state and restart the search at a particular position, then setting the\n/// state to [`OverlappingState::start`] will accomplish that.\n///\n/// # Errors\n///\n/// This routine errors if the search could not complete. This can occur\n/// in a number of circumstances:\n///\n/// * The configuration of the DFA may permit it to \"quit\" the search.\n/// For example, setting quit bytes or enabling heuristic support for\n/// Unicode word boundaries. The default configuration does not enable any\n/// option that could result in the DFA quitting.\n/// * When the provided `Input` configuration is not supported. For\n/// example, by providing an unsupported anchor mode.\n///\n/// When a search returns an error, callers cannot know whether a match\n/// exists or not.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// This example shows how to run a basic overlapping search with a\n/// [`dense::DFA`](crate::dfa::dense::DFA). Notice that we build the\n/// automaton with a `MatchKind::All` configuration. Overlapping searches\n/// are unlikely to work as one would expect when using the default\n/// `MatchKind::LeftmostFirst` match semantics, since leftmost-first\n/// matching is fundamentally incompatible with overlapping searches.\n/// Namely, overlapping searches need to report matches as they are seen,\n/// where as leftmost-first searches will continue searching even after a\n/// match has been observed in order to find the conventional end position\n/// of the match. More concretely, leftmost-first searches use dead states\n/// to terminate a search after a specific match can no longer be extended.\n/// Overlapping searches instead do the opposite by continuing the search\n/// to find totally new matches (potentially of other patterns).\n///\n/// ```\n/// # if cfg!(miri) { return Ok(()); } // miri takes too long\n/// use regex_automata::{\n///     dfa::{Automaton, OverlappingState, dense},\n///     HalfMatch, Input, MatchKind,\n/// };\n///\n/// let dfa = dense::Builder::new()\n///     .configure(dense::Config::new().match_kind(MatchKind::All))\n///     .build_many(&[r\"[[:word:]]+$\", r\"[[:^space:]]+$\"])?;\n/// let haystack = \"@foo\";\n/// let mut state = OverlappingState::start();\n///\n/// let expected = Some(HalfMatch::must(1, 4));\n/// dfa.try_search_overlapping_fwd(&Input::new(haystack), &mut state)?;\n/// assert_eq!(expected, state.get_match());\n///\n/// // The first pattern also matches at the same position, so re-running\n/// // the search will yield another match.
