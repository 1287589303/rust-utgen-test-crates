That\n/// is, from a higher memory address to a lower memory address.\n///\n/// It is often the case that lower level routines dealing with an NFA\n/// don't need to care about whether it is \"meant\" to be matched in reverse\n/// or not. However, there are some specific cases where it matters. For\n/// example, the implementation of CRLF-aware `^` and `$` line anchors\n/// needs to know whether the search is in the forward or reverse\n/// direction. In the forward direction, neither `^` nor `$` should match\n/// when a `\\r` has been seen previously and a `\\n` is next. However, in\n/// the reverse direction, neither `^` nor `$` should match when a `\\n`\n/// has been seen previously and a `\\r` is next. This fundamentally changes\n/// how the state machine is constructed, and thus needs to be altered\n/// based on the direction of the search.\n///\n/// This is automatically set when using a [`Compiler`] with a configuration\n/// where [`Config::reverse`] is enabled. If you're building your own NFA\n/// by hand via a [`Builder`]\n908 pub fn is_reverse(&self) -> bool {\n909     self.0.reverse\n910 }\n\nWhen inferring test input conditions or ranges, consider the following preconditions and expected return values or types:\n"
