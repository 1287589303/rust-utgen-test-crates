  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines, focusing solely on constructing test inputs and calling the functions under test:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions, and reference the inferred test input conditions or ranges.\n7. Ensure the test inputs are designed to cover the inferred test input conditions or ranges as comprehensively as possible, with particular emphasis on boundary cases.\n8. Focus on crafting test inputs that effectively reveal potential bugs while meeting the specified requirements.\n9. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls.\n10. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

Everything is \"just bytes.\" Whether a `Literal` (or\n/// any HIR node) matches valid UTF-8 exclusively can be queried via\n/// [`Properties::is_utf8`].\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// This example shows that concatenations of `Literal` HIR values will\n/// automatically get flattened and combined together. So for example, even\n/// if you concat multiple `Literal` values that are themselves not valid\n/// UTF-8, they might add up to valid UTF-8. This also demonstrates just\n/// how \"smart\" Hir's smart constructors are.\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex_syntax::hir::{Hir, HirKind, Literal};\n///\n/// let literals = vec![\n///     Hir::literal([0xE2]),\n///     Hir::literal([0x98]),\n///     Hir::literal([0x83]),\n/// ];\n/// // Each literal, on its own, is invalid UTF-8.\n/// assert!(literals.iter().all(|hir| !hir.properties().is_utf8()));\n///\n/// let concat = Hir::concat(literals);\n/// // But the concatenation is valid UTF-8!\n/// assert!(concat.properties().is_utf8());\n///\n/// // And also notice that the literals have been concatenated into a\n/// // single `Literal`, to the point where there is no explicit `Concat`!\n/// let expected = HirKind::Literal(Literal(Box::from(\"☃\".as_bytes())));\n/// assert_eq!(&expected, concat.kind());\n/// ```\n///\n/// # Example: building a literal from a `char`\n///\n/// This example shows how to build a single `Hir` literal from a `char`\n/// value. Since a [`Literal`] is just bytes, we just need to UTF-8\n/// encode a `char` value:\n///\n/// ```\n/// use regex_syntax::hir::{Hir, HirKind, Literal};\n///\n/// let ch = '☃';\n/// let got = Hir::literal(ch.encode_utf8(&mut [0; 4]).as_bytes());\n///\n/// let expected = HirKind::Literal(Literal(Box::from(\"☃\".as_bytes())));\n/// assert_eq!(&expected, got.kind());\n/// ```\n342 pub fn literal<B: Into<Box<[u8]>>>(lit: B) -> Hir {\n343     let bytes = lit.into();\n344     if bytes.is_empty() {\n345         return Hir::empty();\n346     }\n347 \n348     let lit = Literal(bytes);\n349     let props = Properties::literal(&lit);\n350     Hir { kind: HirKind::Literal(lit), props }\n351 }\n\nGenerate each test function in such a manner that it concurrently satisfies all the following preconditions:\n",
