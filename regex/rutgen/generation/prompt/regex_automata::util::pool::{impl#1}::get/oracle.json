Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Combine the given function under test, context, relevant documentation, preconditions, expected return values or types, test input conditions or ranges, and existing test function prefixes to infer and generate corresponding test oracles code.\n3. Only generate necessary test oracles to ensure comprehensive validation.\n",

These are used when a Pool is\n    /// accessed by a thread that didn't create it.\n    stack: Mutex<Vec<Box<T>>>,\n    /// A function to create more T values when stack is empty and a caller\n    /// has requested a T.\n    create: F,\n}\npub struct PoolGuard<'a, T: Send, F: Fn() -> T>(inner::PoolGuard<'a, T, F>);\npub(super) struct PoolGuard<'a, T: Send, F: Fn() -> T> {\n    /// The pool that this guard is attached to.\n    pool: &'a Pool<T, F>,\n    /// This is None after the guard has been put back into the pool.\n    value: Option<Box<T>>,\n}\nimpl<T: Send, F: Fn() -> T> Pool<T, F> {\n    #[inline]\n    pub(super) fn get(&self) -> PoolGuard<'_, T, F> {\n        let mut stack = self.stack.lock();\n        let value = match stack.pop() {\n            None => Box::new((self.create)()),\n            Some(value) => value,\n        };\n        PoolGuard {\n            pool: self,\n            value: Some(value),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe function to be tested is presented with each line formatted as 'line number + code':\n/// Get a value from the pool. The caller is guaranteed to have\n/// exclusive access to the given value. Namely, it is guaranteed that\n/// this will never return a value that was returned by another call to\n/// `get` but was not put back into the pool.\n///\n/// When the guard goes out of scope and its destructor is called, then\n/// it will automatically be put back into the pool. Alternatively,\n/// [`PoolGuard::put`] may be used to explicitly put it back in the pool\n/// without relying on its destructor.\n///\n/// Note that there is no guarantee provided about which value in the\n/// pool is returned. That is, calling get, dropping the guard (causing\n/// the value to go back into the pool) and then calling get again is\n/// *not* guaranteed to return the same value received in the first `get`\n/// call.\n181 pub fn get(&self) -> PoolGuard<'_, T, F> {\n182     PoolGuard(self.0.get())\n183 }\n\nThe path conditions that the generated test functions should satisfy are as follows:\n"
