In other\n/// words, the meanings of `a+` and `a+?` are switched.\n///\n/// This setting can also be configured using the inline flag `U` in\n/// the pattern.\n///\n/// Note that this is generally not useful for a `RegexSet` since a\n/// `RegexSet` can only report whether a pattern matches or not. Since\n/// greediness never impacts whether a match is found or not (only the\n/// offsets of the match), it follows that whether parts of a pattern\n/// are greedy or not doesn't matter for a `RegexSet`.\n///\n/// The default for this is `false`.\n",
