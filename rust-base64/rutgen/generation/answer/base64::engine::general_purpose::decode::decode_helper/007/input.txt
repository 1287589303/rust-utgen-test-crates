Input must be a valid base64 encoded slice with lengths from 1 to 32 bytes, rem must be a value between 0 to 3, output slice must be sufficiently large (at least 3/4 the input length), decode_table must be a valid base64 decode table with a size of 256 bytes, and the padding_mode can be any valid DecodePaddingMode variant.
