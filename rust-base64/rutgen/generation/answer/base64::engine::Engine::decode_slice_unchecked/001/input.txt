valid base64 strings of varying lengths, including empty strings, strings containing only padding characters (such as "=="), strings that are valid but just below and above the required length for padding (like "YQ==" and "YQ==A"), completely invalid strings with unexpected characters, and strings that encode to lengths just fitting and exceeding the output slice capacity, as well as edge cases like singular and empty input buffers.
