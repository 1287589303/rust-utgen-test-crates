output_occupied_len in the range [1, BUF_SIZE], with varying values to ensure cases where write_to_delegate returns Ok(()) consistently, and test the transition from output_occupied_len > 0 to output_occupied_len == 0 upon successful writes; also include scenarios where (*left_val != *right_val) to validate correctness.
