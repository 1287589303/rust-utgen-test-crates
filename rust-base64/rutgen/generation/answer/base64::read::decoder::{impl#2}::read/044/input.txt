buf is a non-empty buffer of size less than 3 bytes, self.b64_offset is BUF_SIZE, self.b64_len is BUF_SIZE, self.decoded_len is 0, self.decoded_offset is DECODED_CHUNK_SIZE, self.decoded_len + self.decoded_offset is DECODED_CHUNK_SIZE, self.b64_len is exactly BASE64_CHUNK_SIZE, self.b64_len is 0, at_eof is true, buf.len() is less than DECODED_CHUNK_SIZE, and decode_to_buf invocation succeeds.
