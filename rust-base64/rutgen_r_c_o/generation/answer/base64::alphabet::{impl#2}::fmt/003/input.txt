Test input conditions or ranges: Provide a byte array containing at least one duplicated byte within the range of 0 to 255, ensuring unique representation while including bytes such as 0x00 to 0x1F (control characters), 0x20 to 0x7E (printable ASCII), 0x7F (delete), and beyond to test all edge cases for duplication validation.
