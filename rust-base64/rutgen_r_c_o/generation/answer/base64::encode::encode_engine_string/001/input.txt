input type T should be a byte array or convertible to one, output_buf must be a mutable String, engine must implement Engine, input length range from 0 to a maximum defined by the engine capabilities (e.g., 0 to a typical system memory limit), and input data must be valid for Base64 encoding (i.e., it should not be corrupted or contain illegal byte values).
