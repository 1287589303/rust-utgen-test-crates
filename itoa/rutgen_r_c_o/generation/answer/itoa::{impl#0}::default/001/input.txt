Test input conditions or ranges: Buffer instances should be tested for default initialization (expected to return a Buffer containing an array of MaybeUninit<u8> with length equal to i128::MAX_STR_LEN) and edge cases should include testing Buffer::new() under conditions where the maximum size is approached (although practically constrained by system memory).
