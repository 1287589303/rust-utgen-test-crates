```ChangeLog:1@src/udiv128.rs
FixDescription: Fix mismatched types when asserting the remainder in the test.
OriginalCode@58-61:
[58]    let n = 1 << 83; // This value should trigger the high-case multiplication
[59]    let (_, rem) = udivmod_1e19(n);
[60]    // Verifying that the remainder calculation is failing to meet (*left_val == *right_val)
[61]    assert!(rem != n % 10_000_000_000_000_000_000); // This checks for inconsistency with a known faulty case
FixedCode@58-61:
[58]    let n = 1 << 83; // This value should trigger the high-case multiplication
[59]    let (_, rem) = udivmod_1e19(n);
[60]    // Verifying that the remainder calculation is failing to meet (*left_val == *right_val)
[61]    assert!(u128::from(rem) != n % 10_000_000_000_000_000_000); // This checks for inconsistency with a known faulty case
