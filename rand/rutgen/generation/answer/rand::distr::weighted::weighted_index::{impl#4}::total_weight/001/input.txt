1. The cumulative_weights vector must have at least one element with weights being non-negative values.
2. X must implement traits SampleUniform, PartialOrd, and Clone, ensuring that the type can be properly manipulated and ordered.
3. The total_weight must be a non-negative value that reflects the sum of the weights in cumulative_weights.
4. Test cases should include scenarios where cumulative_weights has one element, multiple elements, and scenarios where the weights are zero or negative (though negative should not be valid).
5. Check boundary cases with cumulative weights being very small (close to zero), very large, and combinations thereof.
