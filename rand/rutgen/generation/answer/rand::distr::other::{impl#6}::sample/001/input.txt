Test input conditions or ranges: rng.next_u32() should produce values from 0 to 2^32 - 1 to cover all possible unsigned 32-bit integer outputs, which when cast to i32, results in return values from -2147483648 (0x80000000) to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF), ensuring both true and false outcomes are tested.
