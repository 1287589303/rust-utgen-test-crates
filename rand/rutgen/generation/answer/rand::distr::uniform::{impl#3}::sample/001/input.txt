Test input conditions or ranges: valid Rng implementations (e.g., Random number generators, mocks), valid Uniform sample types (e.g., UniformInt, UniformFloat), varied sample sizes (including edge cases such as 0 and maximum possible sizes), and diverse randomness states (e.g., seeded, unseeded, and stateful Rngs).
