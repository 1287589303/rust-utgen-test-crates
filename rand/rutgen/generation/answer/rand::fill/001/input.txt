dest must be a mutable reference to a type implementing the Fill trait, with tests on various sizes and types, including an empty array ([]), an array of integers (e.g., [i8; 0], [i8; 20]), a vector of floats (Vec<f32>), and a slice of custom types that implement Fill (e.g., &mut [MyType; 5] where MyType implements Fill).
