Test input conditions or ranges: rng must be a valid instance of RngCore implementing next_u32() that can produce uint32 values within the range of 0 to 4294967295 and must be invoked at least twice before calling next_u64_via_u32, with special consideration for the boundary cases where the outputs are 0 and 4294967295.
