low and high must be within the bounds of the defined range for Self::X, ensure low <= high for inclusive range, check if low and high generate non-finite values for relevant types, test with low = high for edge case, test with various data types supported by SampleBorrow, test with empty range where low > high to trigger EmptyRange error
