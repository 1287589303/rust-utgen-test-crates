Test input conditions or ranges: Test with primitive types (e.g., u32, f64), composite types (e.g., tuples up to 12 elements), and arrays (up to 12 elements with types that implement SampleUniform), ensuring coverage for both edge cases (minimum and maximum sizes) and boundary conditions (types at their limits, e.g., small sizes for integers vs. larger sizes for floats).
