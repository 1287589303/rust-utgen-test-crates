Test input conditions or ranges: D must be a valid Distribution<T> instance, T must be a type that can be sampled from the given distribution, and range values for Uniform distribution should be in a valid range where the lower bound is less than the upper bound (e.g., Uniform::new(lower, upper) where lower < upper).
