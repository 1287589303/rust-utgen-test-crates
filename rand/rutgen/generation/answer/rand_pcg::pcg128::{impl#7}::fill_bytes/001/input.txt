self must be a mutable reference to a Mcg128Xsl64 instance, and dest must be a mutable byte slice of length greater than 0. Additionally, the byte slice should handle typical scenarios such as minimum length (1 byte), standard lengths (e.g., 16 bytes, 32 bytes), and maximum expected lengths based on practical usage in random byte generation.
