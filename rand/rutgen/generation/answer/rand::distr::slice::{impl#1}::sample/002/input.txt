self.slice should be a non-empty slice of type T with length N >= 1, self.range should be a valid UniformUsize range with low = 0 and range = N; test input conditions: idx can be N (boundary case causing debug assert failure) while ensuring the slice is not empty, e.g., slice = &[1, 2, 3] and range sampling setup as described.
