Slice reference (non-empty) of any type T, valid non-negative integer indices for the slice length, and a range of indices corresponding to the potential outputs of the SliceChooseIter iterator, with conditions allowing for boundary indices (0 to slice length - 1) and edge cases like empty slices (expected None return).
