1. dest must be a mutable slice of u8 with lengths ranging from 0 to a maximum of 65536 bytes (inclusive) to cover edge cases of empty and large arrays; 
2. Ensure that at least one valid instance of ReseedingRng with appropriate R and Rsdr types is initialized before the test to ensure expected functionality;
3. Test with dest slice of varying lengths including 0, 1, 2, 255, 256, 1024, 4096, and 65536 bytes to verify correct filling and handling of boundary conditions.
