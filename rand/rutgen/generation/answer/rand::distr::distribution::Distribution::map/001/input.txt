Valid inputs for the function include any instance of a Distribution that adheres to the Trait (e.g., Uniform, Normal) and functions that map the sampled output to a different type, ensuring that the input function is valid for the output type T; boundaries can include scenarios where self represents edge cases in the distribution (like minimum or maximum values for a Uniform distribution).
