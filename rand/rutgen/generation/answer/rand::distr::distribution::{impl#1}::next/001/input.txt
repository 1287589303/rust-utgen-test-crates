D: Distribution<T> must be a valid distribution type, R: Rng must be a valid random number generator, T must be a valid output type; and test input ranges should include: valid distributions including edge cases (e.g., empty distributions), Rng instances with seeded and unseeded states, T types that include boundary values for the expected range of samples.
