Test input conditions or ranges: state must be a u64 value that results in a seed where its size is greater than 4 bytes and is not evenly divisible by 4, for instance state values in the ranges of 0x0000000000000004 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, excluding multiples of 4, such as 0x0000000000000008, 0x000000000000000C, 0x0000000000000010, etc.
