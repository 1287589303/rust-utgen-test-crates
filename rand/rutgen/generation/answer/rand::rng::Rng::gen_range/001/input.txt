T: Test types that implement SampleUniform, R: Ranges that are compatible with the type T, including edge cases like empty ranges and single-element ranges, valid floating-point probabilities for random_bool (0.0 to 1.0), valid ratios for random_ratio (numerator >= 0, denominator > 0), and sufficiently large and small values for all other inputs to cover the typical and edge behavior of the Random Number Generator.
