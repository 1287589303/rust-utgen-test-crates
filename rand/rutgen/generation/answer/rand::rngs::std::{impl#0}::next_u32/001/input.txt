- Test with initialized `StdRng` instance (seeded and unseeded).
- Test with maximum and minimum values for u32 to check edge behavior.
- Test with repeated calls to `next_u32()` to ensure randomness over multiple invocations.
- Validate the output type is always u32 for every invocation of `next_u32()`.
