Test input conditions or ranges: Provide a valid RNG instance; use a variety of distributions (like StandardUniform, Uniform, Alphanumeric, etc.); ensure the number of samples taken is within reasonable limits (e.g., 1 to 1000); include edge cases such as empty distributions or maximum integer range for random sampling.
