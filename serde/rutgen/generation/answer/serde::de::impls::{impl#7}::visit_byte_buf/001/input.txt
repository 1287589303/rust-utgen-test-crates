test input conditions or ranges: v as a Vec<u8> containing non-UTF-8 byte sequences, such as [0xFF, 0xFE, 0xFD], or [0xC3, 0x28] (invalid UTF-8 sequences), covering maximum length based on the Vec<u8> capacity, including empty vector [] and vectors with single byte like [0x80], up to higher boundary cases like [0x80; 1000]
