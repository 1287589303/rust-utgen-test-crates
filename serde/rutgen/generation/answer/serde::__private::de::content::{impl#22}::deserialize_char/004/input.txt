self.content must be of type Content::Char with a valid char value or alternatively, self.content can be of type Content::String with a valid string value containing at least one character, or self.content can also be of type Content::Str with a valid borrowed string slice that contains at least one character; boundary cases include testing with an empty string for Content::String and Content::Str to ensure invalid types are handled correctly.
