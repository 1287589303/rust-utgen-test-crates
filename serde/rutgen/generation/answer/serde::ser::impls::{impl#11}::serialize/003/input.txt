Test input conditions or ranges: Provide a serializer that succeeds on serialize_struct("RangeInclusive", 2) but fails on at least one of state.serialize_field("start", &self.start()) or state.serialize_field("end", &self.end()) in the context of a RangeInclusive with start and end fields that lead to an error during serialization for those fields.
