iter.size_hint() should return a tuple (lower, Some(upper)) where lower and upper are equal for a return value of Some(upper), or a tuple (lower, None) or (lower, Some(upper)) where lower is not equal to upper for a return value of None; test cases should include (0, Some(0)), (1, Some(1)), (2, Some(2)), (5, Some(5)), (3, None), and (0, None).
