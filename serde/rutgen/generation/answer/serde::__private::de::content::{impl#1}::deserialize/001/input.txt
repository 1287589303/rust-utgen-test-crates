Test input conditions or ranges: Valid deserializers implementing `Deserializer<'de>` with various input scenarios including typical, edge cases (such as empty data, maximum size data), and data types covering all enum variants (bool, u8, u16, u32, u64, i8, i16, i32, i64, f32, f64, char, string, str, byte buffer, bytes, none, some, unit, newtype, seq, and map), ensuring coverage for nullable and nested structures.
