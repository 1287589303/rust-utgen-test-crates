Valid input for `next_value<V>` should include: a valid mutable reference to an instance of a type implementing `MapAccess<'de>`, and the type `V` must implement `Deserialize<'de>`; additionally, test cases should cover scenarios where `next_key` has been previously called (e.g., valid, invalid, and edge cases of deserialization types).
