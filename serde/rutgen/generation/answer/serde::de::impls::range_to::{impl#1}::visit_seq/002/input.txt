Test input conditions or ranges: Test with a valid sequence containing a single value for `next_element()` returning `Ok(val)`; test with an empty sequence returning `Err(Error::invalid_length(0, &self))`; additionally, test with a faulty sequence that fails with `Err(err)` to verify error handling.
