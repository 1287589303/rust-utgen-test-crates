test input conditions or ranges: deserializer must return valid tuples for (start, end) where start and end are both comparable values of the same type, including boundary cases such as (0, 0), (i32::MIN, i32::MAX), (f32::MIN, f32::MAX), negative to positive transitions, and non-integer ranges like (1.5, 2.5) while ensuring deserialization can handle various types correctly.
