The test input conditions or ranges include:
1. `name: &'static str` - any valid string literal (e.g., "example").
2. `value: &T` - test with various serializable types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, structs, and enums).
3. Include edge cases such as an empty string, a string that is very large, null values, and types that may not implement `Serialize`.
4. Ensure to test with custom types that implement `Serialize`, including nested structures and enums with different variants.
5. Test the scenario where `T` does not implement the `Serialize` trait, expecting an error from the serialization call.
