Test input conditions or ranges: valid visitor types implementing Visitor<'de>, varying tuple lengths from 0 to N (N being a reasonable upper limit for sequence size in tests, e.g., 100), tuples containing all supported content types (bool, i8, i16, i32, i64, f32, f64, char, string, bytes, etc.), and edge cases like empty tuples and tuples containing unsupported types or malformed sequences.
