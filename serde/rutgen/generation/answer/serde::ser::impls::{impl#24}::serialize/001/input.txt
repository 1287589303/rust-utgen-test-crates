The test input conditions or ranges should ensure that the serializer is human-readable and that the octets contain both valid and invalid cases for serialization, particularly for the output format of the octets as a string.

1. Test with `serializer.is_human_readable()` returning true.
2. Provide an array of octets where `self.octets()` returns values that can vary from 0 to 255 inclusive.
3. Ensure that the first octet is valid (0-255) and present.
4. Ensure that subsequent octets (at least one) can also vary from 0 to 255.
5. Include cases where the octet count is at its minimum (1) and maximum (4) for a valid IPv4-like format.
6. Include edge cases like all octets being 0, or all octets being 255.
