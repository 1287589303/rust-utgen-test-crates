Provide input strings for `field` that cover cases such as valid tag (matching `tag`), valid content (matching `content`), and other strings (not matching either), including edge cases of empty strings and special characters, ensuring that the results reflect the expected enum outcomes: `Tag`, `Content`, and `Other`.
