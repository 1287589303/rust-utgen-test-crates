key can be any type implementing Serialize, including primitives, collections, and custom objects; value can be any type implementing Serialize with similar constraints; test cases should include null values, empty collections, and both matching and mismatched key-value types; verify expected behavior with valid and invalid serialization contexts; cover cases with maximum and minimum input sizes, including single entries and large collections
