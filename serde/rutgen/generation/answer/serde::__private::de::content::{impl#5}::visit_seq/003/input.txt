visitor.size_hint() should yield a valid size within 0 to 10, ensuring at least one Ok(val) and one Err(err) during iteration; test with edge cases like empty and maximum-sized sequences: Ok(Some(value)) followed by Err(error) scenarios, including cases for different Content types (Content::Bool, Content::U8, etc.).
