Test input conditions or ranges: map with key-value pairs where one key is 'tag' (matches TagOrContent::Tag) and multiple keys for Content (matches TagOrContent::Content), and validate cases where the number of 'tag' keys exceeds one or where 'tag' key is missing, ensuring to include boundaries like empty map and single entry maps.
