Input conditions: string `v` that is a valid `&'de str`, where `v` must be a non-empty string, the length of `v` can range from 1 to a reasonable upper limit (e.g., 1024 characters) to cover typical use cases, and must live at least as long as the `Deserializer` reference; also testing should include boundary values like an empty string and a very long string at the upper limit.
