Content::Struct(n, fields) where n is a static string, fields is a vector of tuples with valid (&'static str, Content) pairs containing at least one entry, and Content elements that include diverse types such as Content::Bool(true), Content::String("test"), Content::I32(42), and Content::Seq(vec![Content::Unit, Content::Char('a')]) to ensure coverage of serialization paths, including boundary cases like empty fields and maximum length strings.
